<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-1 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-0 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-1"><p>The holiday season often brings warmth, community, and celebration, but it can also create more financial pressure. Between gift-giving, travel, food costs, and social expectations, money can quickly become a source of stress instead of joy. Holiday spending can be tied to deeper emotional patterns, family expectations, and even a desire to prove worth or create the “perfect” Christmas. Let’s face it, most people struggle with finances at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with financial problems, then you know the anguish that can come from financial instability. Staying up at night worrying about your financial future can be a lonely and terrifying place. But you’re not alone. According to a recent study, the average American has over a hundred thousand dollars in debt.</p>
<h3>Mental and Emotional Impact</h3>
<p>Debt doesn’t just affect our financial stability; it can weigh heavy on our mental and emotional well-being. Therapists see this deep impact regularly. Clients tell stories about how their excessive spending landed them in a painful, and powerless position of debt.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21596" height="300" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/nataliya-melnychuk-aHz832mTOAg-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Many clients share the shame and discouragement that follow seasons of overspending, describing how quickly excitement can turn into a sense of despair later on. Some even speak of their financial situation feeling inescapable. Others tell about their insecurities in social situations because they can’t “keep up” or that life was “no fun” now that they have to skip the salon and dye their roots at home.</p>
<p>The thing about debt is that it often begins in moments that genuinely feel enjoyable. A dream vacation, a new car, or a special purchase can bring excitement, comfort, and even a sense of accomplishment. These experiences and luxuries can temporarily soothe insecurities we all carry and offer a feeling of confidence when we may not feel it inwardly. They can feed our egos as much as they drain our bank accounts.</p>
<p>But when the credit card is cut and the bank account has dwindled, the fun of spending must come to a halt. And that’s not the fun part. We can find ourselves trapped in a cycle of our own making, surrounded by things that no longer feel exciting and electronics that will soon be outdated. And when the urge to spend rises, it becomes even more frustrating because the resources simply aren’t there to satisfy anymore.</p>
<h3>What the Bible Says About Money and Financial Problems</h3>
<p>As we celebrate the birth of Jesus, the ultimate expression of God’s love, we’re reminded that God desires freedom for His people, not bondage. God, in His infinite wisdom, encourages us to stay out of debt because He knows the weight it places on our hearts and lives. In fact, the Bible warns us to avoid debt altogether. Proverbs 22:7 acknowledges the burden of debt and explains that if we borrow, we become servants to the lender, a truth that highlights how debt can subtly steal our peace.</p>
<p>The Bible also offers encouraging words and practical wisdom regarding the topic. Romans 13:6 calls us to work steadily and faithfully toward toward getting out of debt, and in His grace, we are called to extend others a generous heap of grace toward those who are indebted to us. Even though our creditors don’t always follow biblical principles regarding collection, in God’s wisdom, He invites us into a life of freedom, peace, and renewed hope.</p>
<h3>Practical Steps to Get Out of Debt and Address Financial Problems</h3>
<p>We trust that the Lord will help us to meet our basic needs, but that doesn’t mean that the human part of us isn’t up worrying at three a.m. And being told that you shouldn’t be in debt doesn’t help the anxiety you feel if you’re already knee-deep in financial problems. So, where do you go from here?</p>
<p>If you’re truly sick and tired of scraping by each month, there is real hope. The process won’t always feel good or be pleasant, but if you follow these tips for dealing with financial problems, you will find your way out of the financial pit and into a stronger, more secure future.</p>
<p><strong>Pray</strong></p>
<p>One of the simplest and most effective things you can do when your finances are askew is to pray. God wants to help you find peace and resolution. Take it one step at a time, leaning on His infinite wisdom and guidance every step of the way.</p>
<p>Ask for His wisdom in making decisions and seek His strength to overcome your fiscally irresponsible habits. Seek His peace and practical intervention in your situation and lean into His love during your difficult season.</p>
<p><strong>Take Action</strong></p>
<p>Take some practical steps toward controlling your financial situation by negotiating a lower interest rate on your debts. Some credit card companies will work with you if they know you are trying to lower your balance. You may also consider taking advantage of low or no-interest balance transfer offers. While this can be temporarily helpful, it is essential to have a plan to pay down the balance during the promotional period and before the high interest rates take effect.</p>
<p>Some banks will offer an introductory offer to new customers to transfer an existing balance. Be sure to read all the fine print before making this move, but if the conditions are acceptable, it could greatly reduce the amount of interest you are accruing.</p>
<p><strong>Pay Off Your Smallest Debt First</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21597" height="200" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/nataliya-melnychuk-BK1dn_1yWSQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />If you have multiple credit cards or loans, pay off your smallest debt first. This may feel counterintuitive, as most people want to tackle their largest debt because it’s the one that scares them the most. But if you concentrate on paying down your smallest debt first you can soon eliminate it faster.</p>
<p>Then you will have more liquid cash to apply to your larger debts. This strategy will allow you to pay it off sooner than if you make minimum payments. This strategy is often credited to Dave Ramsey and his well-known approach to debt reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Trim the Fat</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t already keep track of your monthly expenses, it’s time to start! Keep track of every cent you spend for a few months to see where you are spending the most money. After you have the information in front of you, take a hard look at your spending.</p>
<p>Are you spending a lot of money on take-out or entertainment? Maybe you’re indulging in a few too many specialty coffees per month. Divide all your expenses into needs, such as basic foods, shelter, and utility bills, and wants like movies, clothing purchases, and consumable items.</p>
<p>Do you really need all those streaming services? Are you actively using the gym membership? Commit to eliminating all extemporaneous spending for a month and reassess. I’m confident you will see a significant increase in your bank account at the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Look for Ways to Save on Necessities</strong></p>
<p>Now that you’ve eliminated all the unnecessary expenses from your budget, look at your monthly bills for ways to save money. Consider making meals at home instead of going out as much. Give yourself a budget line item for takeout.</p>
<p>During the holidays, consider creative ways to save money, such as making thoughtful homemade gifts or cards. Small, intentional choices can ease financial pressure while still honoring the spirit of generosity. You can also look for savings in everyday necessities – compare grocery prices and take advantage of sales or coupon offers.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Your Income</strong></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? Well, it may not be as easy as it sounds, but it’s doable. Seek a part-time job or freelance work on the weekend or after work. Sell unused clothing and other items from around your home at a garage sale or online or consider monetizing a hobby such as selling stock photos online or being a vendor at a local craft fair.</p>
<p>You might also want to take advantage of cash-back shopping apps that reward customers. Once you find a way to increase your income, commit to applying all your extra money to pay down the money you owe. This goes for any bonuses, birthday gifts, or found money. As tempting as it is to spend the special monetary surprises on treats, think about how much less stressed you would be if you had no debt.</p>
<h3>You are Not Your Debt</h3>
<p>In the end, being in debt doesn’t define you. You are defined by the living God who created you and who you follow. This is just a chapter in your life story that, with some perseverance and sacrifice, can have a beautiful and fruitful ending.</p>
<p>God cares about every part of your life, even your finances and financial problems. He can offer you wisdom and provide you with grace when you’re at your most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to reach out for support. A mental health therapist can help you understand your relationship with money and how to break unhealthy habits and replace them with lifestyle changes that will better your financial future and overall peace of mind. The counselors at our location are equipped to help. Call our office today.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The holiday season often brings warmth, community, and celebration, but it can also create more financial pressure. Between gift-giving, travel, food costs, and social expectations, money can quickly become a source of stress instead of joy. Holiday spending can be tied to deeper emotional patterns, family expectations, and even a desire to prove worth or create the “perfect” Christmas. Let’s face it, most people struggle with finances at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with financial problems, then you know the anguish that can come from financial instability. Staying up at night worrying about your financial future can be a lonely and terrifying place. But you’re not alone. According to a recent study, the average American has over a hundred thousand dollars in debt.</p>
<h3>Mental and Emotional Impact</h3>
<p>Debt doesn’t just affect our financial stability; it can weigh heavy on our mental and emotional well-being. Therapists see this deep impact regularly. Clients tell stories about how their excessive spending landed them in a painful, and powerless position of debt.</p>
<img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21596" height="300" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tips-for-dealing-with-financial-problems-during-the-holidays-and-beyond.jpg" width="200" />Many clients share the shame and discouragement that follow seasons of overspending, describing how quickly excitement can turn into a sense of despair later on. Some even speak of their financial situation feeling inescapable. Others tell about their insecurities in social situations because they can’t “keep up” or that life was “no fun” now that they have to skip the salon and dye their roots at home.</p>
<p>The thing about debt is that it often begins in moments that genuinely feel enjoyable. A dream vacation, a new car, or a special purchase can bring excitement, comfort, and even a sense of accomplishment. These experiences and luxuries can temporarily soothe insecurities we all carry and offer a feeling of confidence when we may not feel it inwardly. They can feed our egos as much as they drain our bank accounts.</p>
<p>But when the credit card is cut and the bank account has dwindled, the fun of spending must come to a halt. And that’s not the fun part. We can find ourselves trapped in a cycle of our own making, surrounded by things that no longer feel exciting and electronics that will soon be outdated. And when the urge to spend rises, it becomes even more frustrating because the resources simply aren’t there to satisfy anymore.</p>
<h3>What the Bible Says About Money and Financial Problems</h3>
<p>As we celebrate the birth of Jesus, the ultimate expression of God’s love, we’re reminded that God desires freedom for His people, not bondage. God, in His infinite wisdom, encourages us to stay out of debt because He knows the weight it places on our hearts and lives. In fact, the Bible warns us to avoid debt altogether. Proverbs 22:7 acknowledges the burden of debt and explains that if we borrow, we become servants to the lender, a truth that highlights how debt can subtly steal our peace.</p>
<p>The Bible also offers encouraging words and practical wisdom regarding the topic. Romans 13:6 calls us to work steadily and faithfully toward toward getting out of debt, and in His grace, we are called to extend others a generous heap of grace toward those who are indebted to us. Even though our creditors don’t always follow biblical principles regarding collection, in God’s wisdom, He invites us into a life of freedom, peace, and renewed hope.</p>
<h3>Practical Steps to Get Out of Debt and Address Financial Problems</h3>
<p>We trust that the Lord will help us to meet our basic needs, but that doesn’t mean that the human part of us isn’t up worrying at three a.m. And being told that you shouldn’t be in debt doesn’t help the anxiety you feel if you’re already knee-deep in financial problems. So, where do you go from here?</p>
<p>If you’re truly sick and tired of scraping by each month, there is real hope. The process won’t always feel good or be pleasant, but if you follow these tips for dealing with financial problems, you will find your way out of the financial pit and into a stronger, more secure future.</p>
<p><strong>Pray</strong>
<p>One of the simplest and most effective things you can do when your finances are askew is to pray. God wants to help you find peace and resolution. Take it one step at a time, leaning on His infinite wisdom and guidance every step of the way.</p>
<p>Ask for His wisdom in making decisions and seek His strength to overcome your fiscally irresponsible habits. Seek His peace and practical intervention in your situation and lean into His love during your difficult season.</p>
<p><strong>Take Action</strong></p>
<p>Take some practical steps toward controlling your financial situation by negotiating a lower interest rate on your debts. Some credit card companies will work with you if they know you are trying to lower your balance. You may also consider taking advantage of low or no-interest balance transfer offers. While this can be temporarily helpful, it is essential to have a plan to pay down the balance during the promotional period and before the high interest rates take effect.</p>
<p>Some banks will offer an introductory offer to new customers to transfer an existing balance. Be sure to read all the fine print before making this move, but if the conditions are acceptable, it could greatly reduce the amount of interest you are accruing.</p>
<p><strong>Pay Off Your Smallest Debt First</strong></p>
<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21597" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tips-for-dealing-with-financial-problems-during-the-holidays-and-beyond-2.jpg" width="300" />If you have multiple credit cards or loans, pay off your smallest debt first. This may feel counterintuitive, as most people want to tackle their largest debt because it’s the one that scares them the most. But if you concentrate on paying down your smallest debt first you can soon eliminate it faster.</p>
<p>Then you will have more liquid cash to apply to your larger debts. This strategy will allow you to pay it off sooner than if you make minimum payments. This strategy is often credited to Dave Ramsey and his well-known approach to debt reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Trim the Fat</strong>
<p>If you don’t already keep track of your monthly expenses, it’s time to start! Keep track of every cent you spend for a few months to see where you are spending the most money. After you have the information in front of you, take a hard look at your spending.</p>
<p>Are you spending a lot of money on take-out or entertainment? Maybe you’re indulging in a few too many specialty coffees per month. Divide all your expenses into needs, such as basic foods, shelter, and utility bills, and wants like movies, clothing purchases, and consumable items.</p>
<p>Do you really need all those streaming services? Are you actively using the gym membership? Commit to eliminating all extemporaneous spending for a month and reassess. I’m confident you will see a significant increase in your bank account at the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Look for Ways to Save on Necessities</strong></p>
<p>Now that you’ve eliminated all the unnecessary expenses from your budget, look at your monthly bills for ways to save money. Consider making meals at home instead of going out as much. Give yourself a budget line item for takeout.</p>
<p>During the holidays, consider creative ways to save money, such as making thoughtful homemade gifts or cards. Small, intentional choices can ease financial pressure while still honoring the spirit of generosity. You can also look for savings in everyday necessities – compare grocery prices and take advantage of sales or coupon offers.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Your Income</strong></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? Well, it may not be as easy as it sounds, but it’s doable. Seek a part-time job or freelance work on the weekend or after work. Sell unused clothing and other items from around your home at a garage sale or online or consider monetizing a hobby such as selling stock photos online or being a vendor at a local craft fair.</p>
<p>You might also want to take advantage of cash-back shopping apps that reward customers. Once you find a way to increase your income, commit to applying all your extra money to pay down the money you owe. This goes for any bonuses, birthday gifts, or found money. As tempting as it is to spend the special monetary surprises on treats, think about how much less stressed you would be if you had no debt.</p>
<h3>You are Not Your Debt</h3>
<p>In the end, being in debt doesn’t define you. You are defined by the living God who created you and who you follow. This is just a chapter in your life story that, with some perseverance and sacrifice, can have a beautiful and fruitful ending.</p>
<p>God cares about every part of your life, even your finances and financial problems. He can offer you wisdom and provide you with grace when you’re at your most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to reach out for support. A mental health therapist can help you understand your relationship with money and how to break unhealthy habits and replace them with lifestyle changes that will better your financial future and overall peace of mind.

Between gift-giving, travel, food costs, and social expectations, money can quickly become a source of stress instead of joy. Holiday spending can be tied to deeper emotional patterns, family expectations, and even a desire to prove worth or create the “perfect” Christmas. Let’s face it, most people struggle with finances at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with financial problems, then you know the anguish that can come from financial instability. Staying up at night worrying about your financial future can be a lonely and terrifying place. But you’re not alone. According to a recent study, the average American has over a hundred thousand dollars in debt.</p>
<h3>Mental and Emotional Impact</h3>
<p>Debt doesn’t just affect our financial stability; it can weigh heavy on our mental and emotional well-being. Therapists see this deep impact regularly. Clients tell stories about how their excessive spending landed them in a painful, and powerless position of debt.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-26004" height="300" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/nataliya-melnychuk-aHz832mTOAg-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Many clients share the shame and discouragement that follow seasons of overspending, describing how quickly excitement can turn into a sense of despair later on. Some even speak of their financial situation feeling inescapable. Others tell about their insecurities in social situations because they can’t “keep up” or that life was “no fun” now that they have to skip the salon and dye their roots at home.</p>
<p>The thing about debt is that it often begins in moments that genuinely feel enjoyable. A dream vacation, a new car, or a special purchase can bring excitement, comfort, and even a sense of accomplishment. These experiences and luxuries can temporarily soothe insecurities we all carry and offer a feeling of confidence when we may not feel it inwardly. They can feed our egos as much as they drain our bank accounts.</p>
<p>But when the credit card is cut and the bank account has dwindled, the fun of spending must come to a halt. And that’s not the fun part. We can find ourselves trapped in a cycle of our own making, surrounded by things that no longer feel exciting and electronics that will soon be outdated. And when the urge to spend rises, it becomes even more frustrating because the resources simply aren’t there to satisfy anymore.</p>
<h3>What the Bible Says About Money and Financial Problems</h3>
<p>As we celebrate the birth of Jesus, the ultimate expression of God’s love, we’re reminded that God desires freedom for His people, not bondage. God, in His infinite wisdom, encourages us to stay out of debt because He knows the weight it places on our hearts and lives. In fact, the Bible warns us to avoid debt altogether. Proverbs 22:7 acknowledges the burden of debt and explains that if we borrow, we become servants to the lender, a truth that highlights how debt can subtly steal our peace.</p>
<p>The Bible also offers encouraging words and practical wisdom regarding the topic. Romans 13:6 calls us to work steadily and faithfully toward toward getting out of debt, and in His grace, we are called to extend others a generous heap of grace toward those who are indebted to us. Even though our creditors don’t always follow biblical principles regarding collection, in God’s wisdom, He invites us into a life of freedom, peace, and renewed hope.</p>
<h3>Practical Steps to Get Out of Debt and Address Financial Problems</h3>
<p>We trust that the Lord will help us to meet our basic needs, but that doesn’t mean that the human part of us isn’t up worrying at three a.m. And being told that you shouldn’t be in debt doesn’t help the anxiety you feel if you’re already knee-deep in financial problems. So, where do you go from here?</p>
<p>If you’re truly sick and tired of scraping by each month, there is real hope. The process won’t always feel good or be pleasant, but if you follow these tips for dealing with financial problems, you will find your way out of the financial pit and into a stronger, more secure future.</p>
<p><strong>Pray</strong></p>
<p>One of the simplest and most effective things you can do when your finances are askew is to pray. God wants to help you find peace and resolution. Take it one step at a time, leaning on His infinite wisdom and guidance every step of the way.</p>
<p>Ask for His wisdom in making decisions and seek His strength to overcome your fiscally irresponsible habits. Seek His peace and practical intervention in your situation and lean into His love during your difficult season.</p>
<p><strong>Take Action</strong></p>
<p>Take some practical steps toward controlling your financial situation by negotiating a lower interest rate on your debts. Some credit card companies will work with you if they know you are trying to lower your balance. You may also consider taking advantage of low or no-interest balance transfer offers. While this can be temporarily helpful, it is essential to have a plan to pay down the balance during the promotional period and before the high interest rates take effect.</p>
<p>Some banks will offer an introductory offer to new customers to transfer an existing balance. Be sure to read all the fine print before making this move, but if the conditions are acceptable, it could greatly reduce the amount of interest you are accruing.</p>
<p><strong>Pay Off Your Smallest Debt First</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26005" height="200" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/nataliya-melnychuk-BK1dn_1yWSQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />If you have multiple credit cards or loans, pay off your smallest debt first. This may feel counterintuitive, as most people want to tackle their largest debt because it’s the one that scares them the most. But if you concentrate on paying down your smallest debt first you can soon eliminate it faster.</p>
<p>Then you will have more liquid cash to apply to your larger debts. This strategy will allow you to pay it off sooner than if you make minimum payments. This strategy is often credited to Dave Ramsey and his well-known approach to debt reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Trim the Fat</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t already keep track of your monthly expenses, it’s time to start! Keep track of every cent you spend for a few months to see where you are spending the most money. After you have the information in front of you, take a hard look at your spending.</p>
<p>Are you spending a lot of money on take-out or entertainment? Maybe you’re indulging in a few too many specialty coffees per month. Divide all your expenses into needs, such as basic foods, shelter, and utility bills, and wants like movies, clothing purchases, and consumable items.</p>
<p>Do you really need all those streaming services? Are you actively using the gym membership? Commit to eliminating all extemporaneous spending for a month and reassess. I’m confident you will see a significant increase in your bank account at the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Look for Ways to Save on Necessities</strong></p>
<p>Now that you’ve eliminated all the unnecessary expenses from your budget, look at your monthly bills for ways to save money. Consider making meals at home instead of going out as much. Give yourself a budget line item for takeout.</p>
<p>During the holidays, consider creative ways to save money, such as making thoughtful homemade gifts or cards. Small, intentional choices can ease financial pressure while still honoring the spirit of generosity. You can also look for savings in everyday necessities – compare grocery prices and take advantage of sales or coupon offers.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Your Income</strong></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? Well, it may not be as easy as it sounds, but it’s doable. Seek a part-time job or freelance work on the weekend or after work. Sell unused clothing and other items from around your home at a garage sale or online or consider monetizing a hobby such as selling stock photos online or being a vendor at a local craft fair.</p>
<p>You might also want to take advantage of cash-back shopping apps that reward customers. Once you find a way to increase your income, commit to applying all your extra money to pay down the money you owe. This goes for any bonuses, birthday gifts, or found money. As tempting as it is to spend the special monetary surprises on treats, think about how much less stressed you would be if you had no debt.</p>
<h3>You are Not Your Debt</h3>
<p>In the end, being in debt doesn’t define you. You are defined by the living God who created you and who you follow. This is just a chapter in your life story that, with some perseverance and sacrifice, can have a beautiful and fruitful ending.</p>
<p>God cares about every part of your life, even your finances and financial problems. He can offer you wisdom and provide you with grace when you’re at your most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to reach out for support.

<title>The Role of Exercise in a Healthy Plan for Spiritual Goals</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>There is no reason exercise cannot be included in a plan for spiritual goals. A healthy plan for spiritual goals can include exercise, which is often seen as a physical goal. This goal isn’t a part of a fitness fad. Instead, it is a movement to weave health into spiritual growth.</p>
<p>We often find that the push and pull of physical effort mirrors the spiritual discipline required to cultivate a relationship with God. Christian counselors emphasize that exercise has a role in this journey as a way to honor their bodies and align with spiritual goals.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>…but I strictly discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, </em><em>I myself will not be disqualified.</em> – <strong>1 Corinthians 9:27, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Exercise as a Foundation for Worship</h3>
<p>Exercise can be a cornerstone and a healthy plan for spiritual goals, transforming movement into an active form of worship. With each stride, lift, or stretch, an individual can create a prayer to honor the body as God’s temple. Many Christian counselors encourage exercise as an expression of gratitude and caring for yourself as the vessel God created.</p>
<img alt="The Role of Exercise in a Healthy Plan for Spiritual Goals 3" class="alignleft wp-image-36306" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-role-of-exercise-in-a-healthy-plan-for-spiritual-goals-4-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Having this perspective will shift a workout from chasing vanity to embracing spiritual purpose. As you perform the steady rhythm of physical effort, it will echo the perseverance of your faith and ground your spiritual goals in a daily practice. This connection cultivates a sense of purpose that transcends fleeting cultural ideals.</p>
<p>Society wants us to believe that exercise should result in the sculpting of a perfect body. But a healthy plan for spiritual goals uses exercise as part of your daily spiritual practice. It becomes about showing up to align with God’s design and not the applause of society. When you view exercise as worship, you can turn routine workouts into moments of deep connection with God. It is in this space that spiritual goals can be expressed through physical discipline.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.</em> – <strong>Romans 12:1, NASB</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Building Discipline Through Exercise</h3>
<p>The role of exercise and a healthy plan for spiritual goals is rooted in the ability to foster discipline. Much like an athlete training through fatigue, a believer sometimes needs to push through the doubt to grow in faith. Christian counselors can help.</p>
<p>You can understand how the consistency of a fitness routine requires the steadfastness used in prayer and scripture study. It’s all about choosing to move even when it’s tough. This is the same as choosing to prioritize spiritual growth in daily practice.</p>
<img alt="The Role of Exercise in a Healthy Plan for Spiritual Goals 2" class="alignright wp-image-36305" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-role-of-exercise-in-a-healthy-plan-for-spiritual-goals-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />It’s progress and not perfection. This journey is defined by small choices to build resilience in body and soul. Over time, these habits create a rhythm that aligns daily actions with eternal aims.</p>
<p>Exercise as a spiritual discipline not only strengthens the commitment needed to pursue spiritual goals but also creates a healthy balance in mental wellness. When you can stay focused in the middle of life distractions and demands, it will help your mental wellness, remain positive, and peaceful.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. </em>– <strong>2 Timothy 2:5, ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Overcoming Obstacles in Pursuit of Spiritual Goals</h3>
<p>Your pathway to spiritual goals may be filled with hurdles. The idea of exercise in a healthy plan is to teach resilience. Injuries, time, constraints, and lack of energy are physical barriers that can mirror spiritual challenges, such as doubt and complacency. A Christian counselor will encourage you to see these obstacles as chances to grow, rather than a reason to quit. Exercise builds the perseverance that can help you attain spiritual goals.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to push through physical discomfort in a workout just as you have to endure spiritual trials. The choice to keep going reflects trust in God’s strength, whether you’re tackling a tough hike or you’re in a season of spiritual dryness. In a healthy plan for spiritual goals, exercise will become a training ground for your endurance and equips you to overcome challenges and stay committed to your faith journey.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. – </em><strong>James 1:2-3, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Integrating Exercise into Spiritual Life</h3>
<p>The role exercise has in a healthy plan for spiritual goals often shines through intentional integration with faith. This can be manifested by praying during a run, reflecting on scripture while stretching, or dedicating a workout to God’s glory using specific worship music.</p>
<img alt="The Role of Exercise in a Healthy Plan for Spiritual Goals 1" class="alignleft wp-image-36304" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-role-of-exercise-in-a-healthy-plan-for-spiritual-goals-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Your Christian counselor will guide you in asking how your exercise routine will strengthen your faith. It is this mindset that will ensure exercise supports your spiritual goals and not just your physical ones, and you find holistic, spiritual discipline woven into movement.</p>
<p>Another way to integrate exercise into your spiritual life is through community. When groups share hiking and exercise, along with spiritual practices, it can foster encouragement for a healthy spiritual goal.</p>
<p>Having an accountability partner during a workout is like having the support of a faith community for your relationship with God. Combining exercise with faith can help you create a bond between body and soul and make movement a vital part of pursuing your spiritual goals.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works…</em> – <strong>Hebrews 10:23-24, ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Exercise, Spiritual Goals, and Mental Wellness</h3>
<p>A healthy plan for spiritual goals should involve the body, mind, and soul in a sacred exercise rhythm. This spiritual discipline not only nurtures physical strength but also promotes mental wellness.</p>
<img alt="The Role of Exercise in a Healthy Plan for Spiritual Goals" class="alignright wp-image-36303" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-role-of-exercise-in-a-healthy-plan-for-spiritual-goals-500x333.jpg" width="300" />As you put forth the effort to run or carry out an exercise session, it is the same mindset as striving to find God’s purpose. Movement will foster clarity and ease, reduce anxiety, and alleviate depression. Many Christian counselors believe that this clarity will align with the peace found in spiritual goals.</p>
<p>The world may push exercise toward vanity, but Christian counselors reframe it as a time of worship. As you walk and pray, you can calm your mind and feel more grounded in your faith. Just like prayer can calm an anxious heart, exercising can energize a mind fatigued with negative thoughts.</p>
<p>Christian counselors emphasize that exercise can create space for honoring God’s temple through resilience. This creates a place for spiritual goals, exercise, and mental wellness to intertwine.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.</em> – <strong>Romans 12:1, ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>Exercising for spiritual goals can be transformative. This will turn movement into a sacred act, lay a foundation for worship, and build discipline. You will also find that it can help to build resilience and integrate faith into daily life. It’s not about chasing the ideas of the world, but about honoring God in every step and breath. The tension between spiritual surrender and physical effort will be the space where faith deepens.</p>
<p>This journey of a healthy plan for spiritual goals can mirror the soul’s longing for connection. This longing aligns with God’s eternal design. As you exercise, you can carry your spiritual goals as offerings and trust God to strengthen both your body and your soul for his purpose.</p>
<p>This sacred rhythm promotes peace and keeps you grounded in the midst of life’s chaos. Exercise, as a holy practice, can shape a life where faith and action collide to reflect God’s glory in each moment.</p>
<p>If you need support in your faith or understanding how to use exercise to strengthen your faith, a Christian counselor is a great resource. Connect with someone by calling the office.</p>

<title>The Hidden Trap of Codependency in Church Small Groups</title>
<link>https://texaschristiancounseling.com/articles/the-hidden-trap-of-codependency-in-church-small-groups</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Church was meant to be a place of healing and growth, but with the introduction of small groups, unhealthy codependent behavior patterns have been introduced to believers. In the confines of these small groups, there is a dynamic that can inadvertently foster patterns of codependency.</p>
<p>Disguised as devotion and masked with good intentions, this trap lies hidden. Caring for others becomes a consuming need that fuels the desire to be needed. This creates a cycle of trying to fulfill that need and ultimately leads to exhaustion.</p>
<p>The tension that develops between the biblical community and personal boundaries becomes a complicated dance in a struggle to know where serving ends and self-destruction begins. We were never meant to establish relationships where one person carries the burden and the other contributes nothing. However, in small groups, this imbalance shows up quite frequently and creates a facade about Christ-like love.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ. For if anyone thinks that he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself</em>. – <strong>Galatians 6:2-3, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Recognizing Codependent Behavior Patterns in Faith Communities</h3>
<p>The issue runs deeper than a simple people-pleasing mindset. Sometimes, church environments cause unconscious reward and codependent behavior by celebrating self-sacrifice. The underlying motives aren’t examined because members feel they must take part in everything the church does. Members often prioritize the needs of others above their own, and they fear conflict at all costs. They may even derive their sense of worth from being indispensable leaders.</p>
<img alt="The Hidden Trap of Codependency in Church Small Groups" class="alignleft wp-image-36297" height="150" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-hidden-trap-of-codependency-in-church-small-groups-500x250.jpg" width="300" />Small groups create an atmosphere that promotes vulnerability because of their intimate nature. Members share deep personal struggles, which creates opportunities for other individuals to become emotional rescuers.</p>
<p>These rescuers feel as though they are needed and valuable, and others learn to rely on this consistent source of support. The result is an unhealthy cycle, where the helper is increasingly overwhelmed, and the helped are increasingly dependent.</p>
<p>Paul’s instruction in the New Testament was never meant to eliminate self-care or personal boundaries. Instead, it was supposed to be a mutual consideration where everyone’s needs matter. A healthy Christian community will require individuals who care for themselves as well as for others. These communities shouldn’t require martyrs who sacrifice themselves in ways that serve no one.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No one is to seek his own advantage, but rather that of his neighbor.</em> – <strong>1 Corinthians 10:24, NASB</strong></blockquote>
<h3>The Difference Between Biblical Love and Codependency</h3>
<p>True biblical love creates space for growth and encourages personal responsibility. Codependency, on the other hand, often prevents growth by removing natural consequences and creating an unhealthy dependence.</p>
<p>When love becomes manipulative, even with good intentions, it will cease to be love. Instead, it becomes control. The codependent person will often believe they’re showing compassion, but they are actually enabling destructive patterns to keep others from learning important life lessons.</p>
<p>Christian counselors often observe how enabling behaviors can disguise themselves as mercy. A small group member who consistently rescues others from their poor choices believes they are demonstrating grace. In reality, this pattern prevents those individuals from experiencing the growth that comes through facing consequences. Sometimes real love requires stepping back and<br />
allowing others to experience the discomfort that leads to change.</p>
<p>The church body, according to the Bible, emphasizes that each part has a unique function and contribution. When one member consistently over-functions and others under-function, it creates an imbalance in the body. A healthy relationship in any setting requires that each person carry their own weight and support others at the same time.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>…from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.</em> – <strong>Ephesians 4:16, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>When Helping Hurts: Codependency and Church Leadership</h3>
<p>Church leaders are particularly vulnerable to codependent behavior patterns because their roles naturally involve caring for others. They face pressure to be constantly available, solve everyone’s problems, and maintain harmony, which can create unsustainable habits. When leaders struggle with codependency, they often experience burnout, resentment, and decreased effectiveness because they take on responsibilities that belong to others.</p>
<img alt="The Hidden Trap of Codependency in Church Small Groups 1" class="alignright wp-image-36298" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-hidden-trap-of-codependency-in-church-small-groups-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />The biblical model of leadership involves delegation and shared responsibility. In scripture, we see that even Moses had to learn this lesson when his father-in-law pointed out the unsustainable practice of handling everyone’s needs himself. Modern church leaders require the same wisdom, recognizing when their help may become harmful not only to themselves but also to their communities.</p>
<p>Moses’ father-in-law then said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good. You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.” – Exodus 18:17-18, NASB</p>
<p>In his counsel to Moses, Jethro provided a powerful example of how caring relationships require honest confrontation. True friends and advisors will point out destructive patterns, even when those patterns appear admirable. Christian counselors emphasize that learning to delegate and say no isn’t selfishness. It’s actually a form of stewardship of the resources that God has given.</p>
<h3>Creating Healthy Boundaries in Small Group Relationships</h3>
<p>Establishing boundaries in faith communities requires courage and wisdom. Some believers fear that setting limits will damage relationships or appear unloving. In reality, these healthy boundaries actually strengthen relationships by creating a sustainable pattern of interaction. An authentic community becomes possible when small group members honestly communicate their<br />
limitations and needs with others.</p>
<p>The process begins with self-examination. It is vital that group members identify their own patterns of over-giving or over-receiving and take responsibility for changing these patterns. This could mean that they have to say no to requests for help when they are exhausted, or they learn to ask for support instead of always being the one who provides. This also includes being willing to have a difficult conversation when the relationship has become unbalanced.</p>
<p><img alt="The Hidden Trap of Codependency in Church Small Groups 2" class="alignleft wp-image-36299" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-hidden-trap-of-codependency-in-church-small-groups-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Sometimes friends show the most love by speaking uncomfortable truths about destructive patterns. Small group members need other members who lovingly confront codependent behavior patterns. This requires mature believers who understand that enabling someone’s unhealthy patterns is not kindness. It is a form of harm disguised as help.</p>
<p>Creating a healthy boundary involves recognizing that not every problem will require immediate attention. Sometimes the most helpful response to someone’s struggle is a patient presence instead of an active rescue. This will encourage the individual to cultivate their own problem-solving skills and still feel supported by their community.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Faithful are the wounds of a friend, But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.</em> – <strong>Proverbs 27:6, NASB</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Discover A Healthy Way Forward</h3>
<p>Breaking free from codependency in a church small group will require courage and community commitment to healthier patterns. The goal isn’t to become uncaring or selfish, but instead to love others from a place of wholeness. Believers learned to maintain appropriate boundaries and still care deeply for one another. It creates the kind of community that truly reflects Christ’s love.</p>
<p>This transformation won’t happen overnight, and it will require patience with ourselves and others as everyone learns new ways of relating. Some relationships may need to be redefined as people navigate through this transformation. Freedom comes from breaking codependent behaviors, and it is worth temporary discomfort to establish healthy patterns.</p>
<p>True, spiritual freedom will include the liberty to love others without losing ourselves in the process. Operating from this mindset in small groups will create a foundation that is based on freedom rather than fear, need, or obligation. The result will be a transformation in the lives of the members. This will allow the church to fulfill its calling by empowering each believer to grow in the fullest of who God created them to be, and not create dependence.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</em> – <strong>2 Corinthians 3:17, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Parenting is one of the best and worst jobs you will ever have. It is incredibly rewarding, yet challenging at the same time. All children are different and require different parenting styles to meet each of their individual needs.</p>
<p>But what happens when you have a child who is struggling, and you are handed a diagnosis of ADHD? That moment may feel relieving to you as you finally have an answer that explains all of the struggles you have been facing. You feel light at the end of the tunnel, yet that relief is rapidly swallowed up by more questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to have ADHD?.</li>
<li>Does your child need medication?.</li>
<li>Are there things that you need to change as a parent now?.</li>
<li>How does the school adjust for your child’s needs to help them be successful?.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process of learning about ADHD is one that will be ongoing. You will not learn everything there is to know in the first few weeks or months. You and your child will be on a journey for a long time to come. You will need to make changes and adjustments in different seasons and circumstances, but the good news is, you do not have to do this alone. There are answers to your questions, resources, and support available to help.</p>
<p>The first question, “What does it mean to have ADHD?”, has a lot of answers. Quite simply, it means that your child’s brain processes the world in a way that is different from most people. Everyone receives information, but not every brain responds to that information the same way. Not every ADHD brain processes the same way.</p>
<p>Here are some simple principles for helping your ADHD child.</p>
<h3>Setting priorities for your ADHD child</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with which ADHD children struggle is following a long list of instructions. While an average elementary school child can be given a list of independent tasks and mostly finish them, your ADHD child needs less to accomplish more.</p>
<p>Parents can be overwhelmed by the tyranny of the urgent. There are so many things demanding attention: laundry, bills, mealtimes, texts and emails, and everything piling into a to-do list that is simply a repeated cycle of many tasks.</p>
<p>Your child does not have the same view of things, and your ADHD child definitely will not feel the sense of urgency about things you feel. For both of you to feel successful, it will help to set manageable expectations.</p>
<p>For example, in the mornings, you may want your child to accomplish a list of tasks to be ready to get out the door. It might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make bed.</li>
<li>Eat breakfast and clear his or her dishes.</li>
<li>Pick a clean outfit and dress themselves.</li>
<li>Brush teeth and hair.</li>
<li>Pack a backpack with lunch and homework.</li>
<li>Feed the pet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet you find you are both feeling frustrated when each morning there are things missing or tasks are incomplete. Despite being clear about the expectations, you notice your child is constantly distracted by a toy while getting dressed or forgets something for the backpack.</p>
<p>If you ask yourself, “Does this have to be done now?” you might be able to eliminate a few things and make the morning more manageable for both of you.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat breakfast.</li>
<li>Get dressed (maybe pick out clothes the night before).</li>
<li>Brush teeth and hair.</li>
<li>Double-check the backpack together (which you may have packed the night before).</li>
</ul>
<p>By establishing priorities and regular routines, you can accomplish tasks with greater success. Keep things simple and clear, without changing things too often.</p>
<h3>Being Present in the Moment</h3>
<p>The ADHD brain is something of a wonderland, full of random rabbit trails and strange adventures. Your child will probably start telling you things as if you have been inside that wonderland with him or her, except you have no clue what he or she is saying. Learning how to stay present in the moment takes practice.</p>
<p>Learn how to be an active listener by asking questions and encouraging his or her imagination. This can lead to valuable conversations even when you wonder if you are getting through to your child. Try not to have an agenda, but rather an open-minded approach to having important conversations about growing up.</p>
<img alt="Simple Principles for Parents of a Child with ADHD" class="alignleft wp-image-32908" height="200" src="https://cachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/simple-principles-for-parents-of-a-child-with-adhd-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Staying present in the moment will include setting aside your phone and making space for your child. Distraction is not just an experience of ADHD. Social media, to-do lists, and many other things can distract you as a parent. Learn to create space that is free from the things that distract you to connect with your child in a more meaningful way, even if it is for just a few minutes each day.</p>
<h3>Create or find a supportive network</h3>
<p>You do not have to make this journey on your own. It will take time to create a support network, so keep reaching out. You may connect with support groups online and in person. You may be able to connect with other parents from your school or extracurricular activities, or within a church community as well. Finding friends along the way who can be empathetic and understand what you are going through will be immensely helpful to you.</p>
<p><strong>Educators</strong>
<p>Interact with your child’s teachers, especially the special education teacher, if your child has an IEP. Inform them about your child’s diagnosis and work with them as a team. Learn how to talk about the accommodations that your child needs to succeed in school and what you can do to help at home as well.</p>
<p>An IEP stands for an Individualized Education Plan. Teachers and parents can use these to help your child have the best chance of succeeding in their school environment if your child is struggling to access their education fully due to their challenges with attention and focus.</p>
<p>When you know that your child has ADHD, you can speak to the school to begin the process of looking at what your child needs to be successful in school, which may include putting an IEP in place.</p>
<p><strong>Counselors</strong></p>
<p>Connecting your child to a counselor is another way of providing support to your child. Counselors who have been trained in child development may be able to recognize struggles, as well as offer recommendations for successful tools.</p>
<p>You may also want to see a counselor as you learn to process the challenges of this journey with your child. Your counselor may give insight into your child’s ADHD brain as well as useful tactics for parenting.</p>
<p><strong>Family and friends</strong></p>
<p>It can be difficult to communicate the needs of your ADHD child when you still don’t fully understand those needs yourself. Ask your family and friends to be patient. You may also need to be patient when grandma does her own research and decides to input her own theories about things. There will be friends who want to tell you what they heard about so-and-so, and how such-and-such worked for others.</p>
<p>Continue to have conversations with friends and family to build your relationships. Fostering healthy boundaries and compassionate relationships is important for stability and support.</p>
<h3>Savor the wins and celebrate the gifts</h3>
<p>There are many challenges for your ADHD child that are foreign to neurotypical children. It is not uncommon for ADHD children to have other learning disabilities or other related mental health diagnoses.</p>
<p>You will have many opportunities to learn how to accommodate each of the issues that challenge your child. Be patient with yourself and your child as you search for the solutions that meet your needs.</p>
<p>Whenever you see your child make progress in an area with which he or she has struggled, enjoy the moment of victory. Let your child know that you are proud and encourage him or her to feel proud of his or her achievements.</p>
<p>Learning disabilities do not equal a lack of intelligence. ADHD children are often intelligent in unique and specific ways. Help your child uncover his or her unique gifts. Help your child see that the hyperfocus abilities of ADHD can be like a superpower, and look for opportunities to develop that gift in your child.</p>
<p>Express to your child pride in achievements, support through struggles, and advocacy for his or her needs. As the parent, you have insight into your child and a front seat to the journey of him or her becoming a wonderful adult. Through the ups and downs of this journey, you will both grow stronger.</p>
<h3>Christian Counseling for a Child with ADHD in California</h3>
<p>It is important not to let ADHD be an excuse for bad behavior, but there shouldn’t be any shame or guilt. This is a part of what makes your child unique and wonderful. If you or your child needs help navigating the unique challenges that come with ADHD, don’t hesitate to reach out to our office today to schedule a counseling appointment with me for your child, yourself, or your whole family.</p>

<title>Trusting God During Economic Uncertainty</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>It can be a struggle when your bank account feels fragile, and the news continues to highlight the economic warnings of financial instability. You keep hearing that it’s wise to be financially responsible and save and plan for these types of moments, but you also have faith that has asked you to let go of control. What do you do?</p>
<p>The choices aren’t about being reckless with money; instead, they are about recognizing that your mental health depends on being able to hold both realities at once. This is where Scriptures about trusting God come to life for more than just comfort.</p>
<h3>Trusting God in Tough Times</h3>
<p>Scriptures become a lifeline for psychological resilience when economic uncertainty looms. Just because you need this anchor does not mean that you are weak. Admitting that you need this anchor is an example of being human and wise. Knowing where to turn when your financial foundation is threatened can make a difference in how you navigate uncertainty.</p>
<img alt="Trusting God During Economic Uncertainty" class="alignleft wp-image-36286" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/trusting-god-during-economic-uncertainty-500x333.jpg" width="300" />The financial pressures faced today are unlike anything that previous generations faced. These pressures are intense and swift, with economic shifts happening overnight. Sometimes, job security feels like a myth as healthcare costs climb and retirement savings fluctuate with markets you do not control.</p>
<p>Calculating how long your emergency fund will last is not a reflection of being unfaithful; it shows you’re being realistic. However, what matters is how you remain grounded in your faith during these moments.</p>
<p>Finding Scriptures about trusting God and actually applying them to life are two different things. This gap between knowing and experience is where the real growth happens. Having a strong foundation of faith is vital to understanding and applying the Scriptures during anxious and uncertain times.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. – </em><strong>Philippians 4:6-7, ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>The Mental Health Impact of Economic Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Many may experience the phone buzzing with bill notifications and their chest tightening. Investment accounts are showing red numbers, and the ability to focus on anything else disappears. This financial stress results in anxiety that takes root in the nervous system.</p>
<img alt="Trusting God During Economic Uncertainty 1" class="alignright wp-image-36287" height="300" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/trusting-god-during-economic-uncertainty-2-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Financial worry is one of the most consistent predictors of anxiety, sleep disorders, and depression. Being uncertain about your economic stability shifts your brain into threat-detection mode, which is exhausting to maintain. Your body floods with cortisol, your sleep becomes fractured, and your ability to think clearly deteriorates.</p>
<p>A person of faith will experience a different kind of tension. It’s the tension between trust and a sense of responsibility. You know that God provides, and you have been taught that you need to provide for yourself. This is a contradiction that can leave you feeling torn and create a mental health crisis beyond the financial struggles.</p>
<p>You have become concerned that worrying about money means you don’t have enough faith, and this adds a layer of shame that makes everything worse. The struggle to manage the anxiety and guilt about having anxiety is added to the psychological burden of feeling insecure in economic uncertainty.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>…casting all your cares on him, because he cares for you.</em> – <strong>1 Peter 5:7, ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Understanding Scriptures About Trusting God Through a Mental Health Lens</h3>
<p>Meeting with a Christian counselor during a season of economic uncertainty is more than just sharing your problems or hearing that you should believe harder. A good Christian counselor will understand that Scriptures about trusting God aren’t magical formulas to make everything easy. They will show you that they are a framework to help your mind process threats. When you put Scriptures about trusting God into practice, you are retraining your brain.</p>
<p>It is the mechanism of trust that makes practicing Scriptures significant for your mental health. But when you genuinely trust something larger than your circumstances, your nervous system can regulate, and your cortisol levels drop. It will help improve your sleep and make clear decisions.</p>
<img alt="Trusting God During Economic Uncertainty 2" class="alignleft wp-image-36288" height="300" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/trusting-god-during-economic-uncertainty-3-375x500.jpg" width="225" />Christian counselors understand this process because they observe how people shift from panic to a sense of groundedness when they learn to incorporate Scripture and trust God. They help you recognize that this is the result of the change in how you relate to your circumstances.</p>
<p>Christian counselors are also aware that you might resist this process. They recognize that you may think you are being an irresponsible adult and admitting defeat. It is normal to feel concerned that believing Scriptures about trusting God means you should stop planning for your future. Trust doesn’t mean passivity, and this is where true wisdom will emerge.</p>
<p>Christian counselors are there to help you do your part by acknowledging that outcomes depend on factors beyond your control.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</em> – <strong>Proverbs 3:5-6, ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Building Mental Resilience Using Scriptures About Trusting God</h3>
<p>Trust doesn’t just happen because you say you are going to trust. Trust is built through practice and small moments of choosing faith over anxiety. Scriptures about trusting God can move from abstract theology into your daily experience of life.</p>
<p>When you catch yourself spiraling about financial uncertainty and redirect your mind toward your belief in God’s provision, you are rewiring your brain’s response. By speaking the Scriptures aloud instead of allowing catastrophic thinking to overpower your mind, you create new neural pathways.</p>
<p>This is not some magical process of thinking; it is neuroscience wrapped in faith language. There are patterns in your brain that light up when financial stress hits, and worry is the automatic response because your mind has evolved to anticipate threat. By practicing redirecting to Scriptures on trusting God, you are creating a new thought process.</p>
<p>This builds new mental structures through the practice of redirecting thoughts. Anxiety does not heal by having one breakthrough moment. It is healed by choosing faith intentionally every day, though it may feel uncomfortable or premature.</p>
<p>Consistency and embodiment will lead to mental health benefits. This comes from thinking about, speaking, writing, and meditating on the Scriptures. The combination of these actions will reshape your internal dialogue when your mind wants to catastrophize about economic uncertainty and its effect on your life.</p>
<p>Scriptures about God’s provision will become part of your neural network, offering alternative ways of thinking. This is faith at work, and it is what your mental health needs during economic uncertainty.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</em> – <strong>Philippians 4:19, ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Transforming Your Response to Economic Uncertainty</h3>
<p>You can reach a moment when practicing Scriptures about trusting God becomes second nature. It happens when you realize that you can’t actually control most of the things that create fear during this uncertain time.</p>
<img alt="Trusting God During Economic Uncertainty 3" class="alignright wp-image-36289" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/trusting-god-during-economic-uncertainty-4-500x333.jpg" width="300" />It is a liberating moment when you fully understand that you have been trying to guarantee something ungovernable, and it has been detrimental to your mental health. It is at this point that your mindset will pivot because you understand that all of the planning in the world cannot guarantee anything about changes in a job or the economy.</p>
<p>As you stop trying to manipulate and ensure these outcomes, something will shift in your psychological state. You’ll be able to make good money decisions without needing to achieve certainty. You’re able to work diligently without it needing to equate to security. You’ll be able to plan responsibly and understand that plans are predictions, not guarantees.</p>
<p>This practical transformation that comes from understanding Scriptures about trusting God brings forth liberation. It brings freedom from the impossible demand that you control the uncontrollable.</p>
<p>By integrating faith and mental health, you have created a foundation of wisdom for decision-making during uncertain economic times. This doesn’t mean you’re choosing between being responsible and being faithful, but it reflects how you acknowledge what is beyond your control and trust God accordingly. The result is a decrease in anxiety or depression in relation to economic uncertainty because the relationship to the situation has transformed fundamentally.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</em> – <strong>Matthew 6:34, ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Learning to Trust</h3>
<p>Economic uncertainty is not going away anytime soon, and your human tendency to worry and plan will not disappear either. But when you use Scripture about trusting God as a foundation for working through fears and concerns, you create a framework that cultivates peace in chaos.</p>
<p>Christian counselors can help you formulate strategies for using Scriptures about trusting God to create a positive environment in your home, even when the economy seems to spin out of control.</p>

<title>Coping With Grief: One Year Later</title>
<link>https://texaschristiancounseling.com/articles/coping-with-grief-one-year-later</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Losing a loved one is traumatic. Coping with grief in the first year can leave you physically and mentally drained. Grief is unpredictable. It can sneak up on you and hit you like a wave. You may go days or weeks without a tear, and then a small object or the scent of a cologne can send you into an emotional upheaval.</p>
<p>When the first anniversary of your loved one’s passing comes along, it can feel as if it just happened in the blink of an eye, and simultaneously, as if it has been the longest year of your life.</p>
<h3>Tips for Coping with Grief</h3>
<p>Coping with grief takes a tremendous amount of energy. You feel the sadness and pain alongside the responsibility of carrying on, taking care of family, and other obligations. After several months, you may have gotten into a routine, moving about your day, and trying to keep your mind off who is missing.</p>
<p>But when the first anniversary approaches, the wound may reopen. Memories may come flooding back. Dreams may become more intense, and those moments of sadness may renew.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath and know that what you are feeling is normal, and it, too, is a part of the healing journey from loss. The following are several tips for coping with grief upon the first anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>Let someone in</strong></p>
<img alt="Coping With Grief: One Year Later 3" class="alignleft wp-image-36279" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/coping-with-grief-one-year-later-4-500x334.jpg" width="300" />It is easy to isolate after a loss. Your heart is broken, and the thought of sharing that heartbreak with others somehow seems wrong. But letting someone in, whether a trusted friend or family member, relieves you of some of the emotional burden. The person you trust can share in the memories and also provide you with a solid place to land, grounding you in the present.</p>
<p>The first anniversary is a time for remembrance, but don’t do it alone. Lean into a close friend or family member at this time. Choose someone with whom you feel you can laugh and cry. Choose a person who understands loss and is available to be the first in your support network.</p>
<p><strong>Process those emotions</strong>
<p>Unprocessed emotions will only lead to physical and mental problems. For example, tamping down feelings instead of expressing them causes chronic stress and the release of stress hormones, like cortisol. Too much stress and a chronic state of fight-or-flight can result in high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, panic attacks, anxiety, depression, weight changes, appetite and sleep changes, headaches, digestive issues, and unexplained aches and pains.</p>
<p>Find a way to express your emotions. Consider journaling or engaging in other creative outlets, such as painting or drawing. Allow yourself the time to feel your emotions around the first anniversary. You may have different feelings one year later.</p>
<p>Perhaps you felt anger or resentment when the death first occurred, but now you have a different perspective and only feel sadness. In another year, you may be able to look back without the intense emotion. The feeling of missing your loved one will always be there, but the grief as a tangible force may have lessened over time.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on your health</strong></p>
<p>Although not expressly a part of the healing journey, focusing on your health the first year and beyond can help you move forward. You have a responsibility toward your loved one to care for yourself. This means attending all doctor appointments, taking medications correctly, exercising, eating healthy foods most of the time, and taking care of your hygiene and appearance.</p>
<img alt="Coping With Grief: One Year Later 2" class="alignright wp-image-36278" height="225" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/coping-with-grief-one-year-later-3-500x375.jpg" width="300" />When we lose a loved one, we tend to place ourselves on the back burner. Persistent sadness and fatigue can make it too much of an effort to shower and dress. Women may stop wearing makeup or fixing their hair. Men may stop shaving or trimming their beards. Getting dressed for the day may seem like too much time.</p>
<p>We no longer care for our own bodies. Yet, this is the only vessel we must live in for the time God has given us on this Earth. Focus on improving your health, one step at a time. Consult with a nutritionist, personal trainer, or counselor if you need help.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid substances that numb the pain</strong>
<p>As humans, we try to avoid pain and feeling uncomfortable. Coping with grief in a healthy manner means processing those emotions and giving them room, so that you can heal. If you numb the pain to the point that you can no longer feel sadness or hurt, the pain will manifest in other ways.</p>
<p>Alcohol, drugs, food, and other addictions can temporarily mask the grief, but eventually these vices will harm you physically, mentally, emotionally, relationally, and possibly financially. Consult with a counselor if you have found yourself numbing your feelings with substances or activities that will only hurt you in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Honor your loved one on the first anniversary</strong></p>
<img alt="Coping With Grief: One Year Later 1" class="alignleft wp-image-36277" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/coping-with-grief-one-year-later-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Allow yourself to remember your loved one on the first anniversary. Instead of hiding indoors or staying in bed, consider honoring them with something special. Perhaps visit the cemetery with their favorite flowers, invite people over for dinner to share memories, or watch your loved one’s favorite movies.</p>
<p>Think of the first anniversary as more of a celebration of life. Celebrate who they were in your life and in the lives of others. By shifting perspective and focusing on the day, you appreciate what they brought into the world and how much better your life is because you knew them.</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorm ideas for managing special occasions</strong>
<p>Besides the first anniversary, you will experience special occasions and holidays without your loved one. These days may bring a new wave of grief. Prepare yourself by brainstorming ideas for creating new traditions.</p>
<p>For example, if this is your first Christmas without your spouse, spend a few minutes honoring them by doing something special that the two of you loved. But also create a new tradition just for you. You could watch a movie that the two of you loved, then attend a Christmas cantata with a few friends.</p>
<p><strong>Take time off to reflect</strong></p>
<p>As the first anniversary approaches, prepare for your emotions by taking a few days off from work. You may want to delegate tasks to others. Take time off from work or school. Take it easier on the days leading up to the date, especially if your emotions are running high.</p>
<p>Give yourself the time to reflect on the memories and the goals you have set for yourself to move forward.</p>
<p><strong>Forgive yourself</strong></p>
<p>If you are holding onto anger, bitterness, resentment, guilt, or shame from something you said or did (or didn’t say or do) to your loved one, it is time to forgive yourself. Or, maybe your loved one said or did something that hurt you and never had the chance to make it right. Holding onto these emotions over time only burdens you. Set yourself free by letting it go.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble forgiving yourself or your loved one, turn to God and read Scripture about forgiveness. For example, John 1:9 reminds us that when we confess our sins to God, He forgives and cleanses us from all sin. Matthew 6:14-15 also reminds us that when we forgive others, God also forgives us. If you struggle with forgiveness, a Christian counselor can help you.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Coping With Grief: One Year Later" class="alignright wp-image-36276" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/coping-with-grief-one-year-later-500x334.jpg" width="300" />Find a support group</strong></p>
<p>A support group offers encouragement and advice when you need it most. Attending meetings before the first anniversary can prepare you for any negative thoughts or emotions that may occur. Support groups are excellent places to role-play how you will manage holidays and other events. You can also offer support to other participants who may have just lost a loved one.</p>
<h3>Grief Counseling Now Has a Virtual Option</h3>
<p>The grieving process is personal. No one grieves the same way or for the same length of time. However, if coping with grief interferes with your daily life and responsibilities and your ability to move forward, reach out for help.

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-2 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-1 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-2"><p>Perfectionism is a personality trait characterized by striving to be flawless. It is often considered to be a desirable trait in our society. When not taken to the extreme, it can be a healthy motivator that helps you achieve your goals and feel successful and fulfilled.</p>
<p>This is known as adaptive perfectionism. You set high standards for yourself, strive for excellence, and put a lot of time and effort into achieving your goals, but you can be flexible and adjust them when necessary, and do not berate yourself if you fail to meet them.</p>
<p>Maladaptive perfectionism, on the other hand, is characterized by harsh self-criticism when you don’t meet your standards, ruminating over your mistakes, and excessive fear of failure, which can cause chronic stress and anxiety, chip away at your self-esteem, and erode your confidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When you set unrealistic standards, you’ll always fail. </em><strong>– Monique Williamson, LMFT</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both forms of perfectionism involve setting high standards. The key difference is what you say to yourself when those standards are not met. Adaptive perfectionists, for instance, are motivated to do things as well as possible, but can maintain a healthy balance between striving for excellence, recognizing when their work is good enough to be considered done, and practicing self-compassion when the end result doesn’t meet their expectations.</p>
<p>However, maladaptive perfectionists never feel satisfied, beat themselves up when they are unable to achieve their rigid, unrealistic goals, and are driven by an intense fear of failure and being judged, rather than by positive motivation to do a job well.</p>
<h3>Effects Of Maladaptive Perfectionism</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Perfection is self-destructive simply because there’s no such thing as perfect. Perfection is an unattainable goal. </em><strong>– Brené Brown</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maladaptive perfectionism influences the way you think, feel, and act, and can have a negative impact on every area of your life, including your physical and mental health, stress level, relationships, and overall well-being. Though it may manifest differently in different people, the following are some of the most common areas affected.</p>
<p><strong>Physical health</strong> You tend to experience significant stress, which can result in physical symptoms such as muscle tension, unexplained aches and pains, digestive issues, and trouble sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional health</strong> Fear of failure and judgment can lead to constant anxiety, which makes it difficult for you to relax and enjoy life. You may be prone to mood swings and have a short fuse when things do not go according to plan, or react the opposite way and try to cope by shutting down to avoid your distressing feelings, or seek escape through overeating, drugs, or alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Mental health</strong> Constant rumination of past mistakes and anxiety over possible future failures make it hard for you to focus on the present moment. Excessive worry about all the possibilities and about getting every detail right makes it difficult for you to make decisions, leading to indecisiveness and inaction.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of work-life balance</strong> Your relentless pursuit of perfection leaves you with little or no time or energy for anything else – hobbies, relationships, or self-care.</p>
<p><strong>Missed opportunities</strong> You may often miss out on opportunities and be hindered from advancing in your career due to fear of failure or not measuring up to others, holding you back from trying new things or exploring new possibilities in your personal or professional life.</p>
<p><strong>Relationships</strong> Work takes priority, leaving little time or energy for forming meaningful connections with others. You may be physically present, but your mind tends to be distracted and elsewhere. You also worry that if you are yourself, you will be judged and found lacking, so you keep people at a distance and only show parts of yourself you think will be acceptable.</p>
<h3>Signs And Symptoms of Maladaptive Perfectionism</h3>
<p><strong>Unattainable standards</strong> You constantly strive for perfection in everything you do, can’t accept anything less, and hold yourself to unreasonably high, often unattainable standards and goals you set for yourself that are impossible to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Fear of failure</strong> You have an intense fear of failure and feel driven to avoid mistakes and achieve perfection in every area of your daily life. When you fall short, you spiral into anxiety and shame.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25999" height="200" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/kaylee-garrett-GaprWyIw66o-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Self-worth is dependent on achievements</strong> Your sense of self-worth is dependent on whether or not you do things perfectly, and you view mistakes as an indication that you are less than, a failure as a person, and can never measure up.</p>
<p><strong>Avoidance of tasks due to fear of failure</strong> Fear of not being able to do something perfectly may be so strong that it stops you from even trying. You believe that if you can’t do it perfectly, it is better not to try doing it at all.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of resilience</strong> You are so focused on achieving perfection and avoiding failure that there is little to no room for error, and you are unable to adapt to setbacks or cope with the ups and downs of life.</p>
<p><strong>All or nothing thinking</strong> You tend to see things in extremes of black or white, without any middle ground of gray.</p>
<p><strong>Catastrophizing</strong> You are quick to jump to conclusions and envision worst-case scenarios, even if they are unrealistic and unlikely to take place.</p>
<h3>Practical Tips for Overcoming Maladaptive Perfectionism</h3>
<p>Maladaptive perfectionism can be overcome with the help of practical self-help strategies and/or the assistance of a trained mental health professional. The journey is not about changing who you are, but about learning to use your perfectionist traits in ways that enhance your life and accomplishments rather than hinder them.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to recognize and challenge maladaptive perfectionist thoughts</strong> Challenge your critical thoughts and look for more balanced, realistic perspectives to replace them with. Remind yourself that mistakes and imperfections are part of being human.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge your fear of failure</strong> Accept failure as a normal part of life and an opportunity for growth. See your mistakes as learning experiences and stepping stones to success.</p>
<p><strong>Practice being flexible and setting realistic goals</strong> Practice adjusting your expectations and being open to different outcomes. Instead of rigidly fixating on doing everything perfectly, focus on doing your best and allowing yourself to achieve a good enough result.</p>
<p>Break larger goals down into smaller, more manageable ones, celebrate small victories along the way, and accept that mistakes and setbacks are learning opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Have compassion for yourself</strong> Treat yourself kindly instead of being harshly critical in the face of failure. Interrupt the self-critical voice in your head and replace harsh statements with more realistic, positive ones. Tell yourself it’s okay if something isn’t perfect, acknowledge mistakes as part of being human, and celebrate any progress, even if it is not flawless.</p>
<p><strong>Find ways to reduce stress and anxiety</strong> Practice stress-reducing coping techniques such as deep breathing and relaxation, and grounding exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritize self-care</strong> Establish and maintain a balanced lifestyle by prioritizing healthy eating, getting enough sleep, engaging in regular exercise, and making time for relaxation and activities you enjoy, and that recharge your energy.</p>
<p><strong>Practice doing nothing</strong> Whether mindfulness or meditation, practice doing the opposite action of what your mind wants to do. Sit in silence, focusing on your breath or a worthiness statement, and don’t produce anything. Start with 10 seconds, then work your way up to a few minutes over time. It’s a wonderful way to challenge your thoughts and beliefs that say you have to earn worthiness by doing.</p>
<p><strong>Consider counseling</strong> A trained mental health professional can help you identify and address what’s at the roots of your maladaptive perfectionism, as well as learn how to set achievable goals for yourself rather than improbable or impossible ones, shift your focus to what you did well rather than what you did wrong, and develop coping strategies to handle fear and stress in healthy ways.</p>
<h3>Therapy For Maladaptive Perfectionism</h3>
<p>There are several successful treatment modalities for treating maladaptive perfectionism, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which helps you identify and challenge overly perfectionist thought patterns and replace them with more realistic ones</li>
<li>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), which focuses on having you confront thoughts and fears that cause you distress and learn new ways of responding to them</li>
<li>Radically Open Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (RO DBT), which focuses on helping you develop openness, flexibility, and social connectedness.</li>
</ul>

<title>Using a Mindfulness Journal to Transform Anxiety into Peace</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s culture, we are led to believe that busyness equals success and should be celebrated. However, this creates an unusually high level of anxiety for most Americans. Many of us feel as though we are drowning in our thoughts due to the constant pressure to perform, provide, and maintain suitable appearances.</p>
<p>The resulting impossible situation creates internal chaos as we battle the narrative of being strong in hard times. A mindfulness journal becomes a great tool in protecting our peace.</p>
<p>This journal will bridge the gap between faith and mental wellness, creating a safe space for processing anxiety. The beauty of this tool is not in the complexity of any technique; on the contrary, it is found in the simplicity of its purpose. Sometimes we don’t need elaborate self-help programs or costly therapy. If we simply reach for a pen and paper and have the willingness to honestly examine our thoughts, we find that journaling is one of the most soothing tools.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</em> – <strong>Philippians 4:6-7 ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Understanding the Mind-Body Connection in Anxiety</h3>
<p>Anxiety isn’t just in our minds; it affects our entire being. The most common symptoms we feel are racing hearts, tight chests, and restless limbs. Anxiety isn’t just worried thoughts. Our bodies respond to any type of perceived threat, whether it’s real or imagined. This creates a cycle of physical symptoms that will ignite mental distress, which in turn amplifies the physical symptoms.</p>
<p>This intricate mind-body connection is not a flaw. It is precisely how God created us to respond to genuine danger. Problems arise when our threat detection system becomes hyperactive, and everyday stressors are treated as though they are a life-or-death situation. This leaves us living in a constant state of alert. Struggling with battles that exist only in our minds can lead to total exhaustion of the entire body.</p>
<p>When we understand the connection, we can approach anxiety with greater wisdom. Identifying that those racing thoughts are triggering a physical response can help us use mindfulness techniques to break this vicious cycle. Journaling can become a way to externalize the internal chaos and give us perspective on the thoughts trapped in our heads that are overwhelming us.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!</em> – <strong>Psalm 139:23-24 ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Creating Your Mindfulness Journal Routine</h3>
<p>Establishing a mindfulness journal routine doesn’t require that we have perfect conditions or elaborate rituals. We simply start where we are in the time that we have, using the resources available.</p>
<p>It does not require that we buy a brand-new, expensive journal or set up an elaborate table with candles to start this new routine. It only asks that we have consistency, not perfection. The goal is honest reflection to help shift our relationship with our anxious thoughts.</p>
<p>The first step is choosing a time and a place where we can sit down and journal. There are no rules about what time of day or what the space will look like. What matters is the commitment to be intentional with regular journaling time. Creating a simple space that gives us a feeling of peace helps set the tone for mindfulness journaling. We want to have a sense of God’s presence as we work through these intruding thoughts.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I said, “Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart.” Then my spirit made a diligent search – </em><strong>Psalm 77:6 ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Mindfulness Journaling Techniques for Anxious Thoughts</h3>
<p>One of the first things we often do when anxiety strikes is to fight the thoughts or push them away. This approach often backfires, leading to more tension and causing the patterns we are trying to break to become stronger. Mindfulness journaling offers us a different approach through observing our thoughts with curiosity rather than judgment.</p>
<img alt="Using a Mindfulness Journal to Transform Anxiety into Peace 1" class="alignleft wp-image-6954" height="169" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/using-a-mindfulness-journal-to-transform-anxiety-into-peace-2-310x174.jpg" width="300" />We begin by writing down what we’re experiencing in the moment. It’s not about grammar structure or even making sense. By letting the words flow onto the page without editing or censoring, we get a process of externalization. We then experience immediate relief and reduce the huge and overwhelming thoughts into manageable words on paper.</p>
<p>Next, we look at our thoughts as observers. We then write about the anxiety as if we’re describing another person’s experience. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I notice thoughts about work deadlines creating tension in my shoulders.”</li>
<li>“There’s a story playing in my mind about everything going wrong.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This shift and language create a psychological distance, which can help us see thoughts as a temporary mental event and not as absolute truths.</p>
<p>Christian counselors often use this technique to help us recognize differences between our identity and our thoughts. We are not our anxiety. We are children of God, who sometimes experience anxious thinking. We must recognize this distinction to develop a healthy relationship between our mental and emotional experiences.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ.</em> – <strong>2 Corinthians 10:5 ESV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Building Long-Term Peace Through Consistent Practice</h3>
<p>It is the accumulation of small, consistent efforts of journaling that cause the real transformation. Just as with any other spiritual discipline, mindfulness journaling requires patience and intentionality. We are rewiring patterns that have been deeply ingrained, and this doesn’t happen overnight.</p>
<p>We can expect some resistance, both internally and externally. Our minds have grown accustomed to the anxious patterns and may fight against a new approach. Those around us may not understand the value of taking time for reflection. There will be days when the practice may seem pointless or difficult. These are normal challenges that are part of the growth process and are not indicators of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>We can track our progress by noting patterns in our journal entries over time. We might make a discovery regarding triggers that consistently provoke anxiety, or that certain techniques are more helpful than others.</p>
<p>This awareness allows for the development of personalized strategies to manage stress. Celebrate the small victories. When we notice anxious thoughts sooner or when we’re able to return to calm more quickly than usual, it is encouraging to take time to celebrate that change.</p>
<p>The goal is not about eliminating anxiety, but rather to develop a different relationship with it, turning to God for help and greater dependence upon Him. We learn to see anxiety as information rather than an emergency. It is a visitor and not a permanent resident. This shift in our perspective reduces anxiety’s power over our daily lives.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.</em> – <strong>Isaiah 26:3 ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Finding Peace</h3>
<p>Our mindfulness journal isn’t a magic solution to instantly eliminate anxiety. But it is a powerful tool for our transformation. Through intentional practice, we will learn to observe our thoughts with compassion and interrupt anxiety cycles. This approach helps us cultivate a true peace and contentment that comes from God.</p>
<p>Mindfulness journaling requires patience, but the rewards make it a worthwhile endeavor. We will achieve greater self-awareness, improved emotional regulation, and a deeper spiritual connection, the more we are intentional with mindfulness journaling.</p>
<p>The beauty is that this practice is accessible. There’s no special training or expensive equipment needed. We simply choose to show up honestly with our thoughts and emotions and trust that God will meet us in that vulnerable space. The more we continue this practice, the more we will find that the peace we were seeking was available all along. We must choose to create the quiet space necessary to receive it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.</em> – <strong>1 Peter 5:7 ESV</strong></p></blockquote>

<title>How Being a People Pleaser Can Invite Toxic Friendships</title>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-2 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-1 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-2"><p>Being agreeable sounds like a good thing, right? In fact, as a child, you were probably told to “just get along” with your siblings or to “just go with the flow” during family vacation. Being agreeable can be a good thing and often appears to be humility and love, but for people pleasers, the motive isn’t love at all; it’s fear.</p>
<p>People pleasers don’t want to upset anyone, so they say “yes” to everything. They go along with the group plans even when they are uncomfortable. They apologize even when they’ve done nothing wrong. Underneath all those yeses and sorries is often the quiet belief that if they keep everyone happy, they’ll be liked and admired.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that isn’t usually the case. The opposite is often true. Fear-based kindness is a breeding ground for unhealthy, toxic relationships.</p>
<p>The Scripture even warns about trying to please people. In Proverbs 29:25, it says, “The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe.” Fear of people’s disapproval creates a trap. It pulls you into relationships that are one-sided and manipulative. Sadly, it invites the very thing you were trying to avoid, like rejection, disrespect, and emotional fatigue.</p>
<h3>Toxic people are drawn to people pleasers</h3>
<p>Manipulators are drawn to people who don’t push back against their aggression. They are drawn to people who over-apologize and who want to keep the peace so badly that they tolerate anything, even being disrespected.</p>
<p>To a toxic person, a passive people-pleaser appears to be the ideal friend. They love to attach themselves to someone who will offer them no resistance, confrontation, or challenge. And what the people-pleaser themselves see as “easygoing” is an open invitation to toxic people for misuse.</p>
<h3>The Message People Pleasing Conveys</h3>
<p>Saying “Whatever you want” repeatedly sounds harmless, even cooperative, but it communicates a negative message. It is telling the other person in your life that your voice doesn’t matter, that they get to decide everything, and that their needs come before your own. It teaches others to stop asking for your input and to assume that you really don’t care.</p>
<p>Eventually, people stop seeing you as a whole person with needs and preferences of your own. You are reduced to the role of helper, fixer, and emotional support person, but not a person with equality. People pleasing keeps you in quiet frustration and blinds everyone else to your needs.</p>
<h3>Even Jesus had boundaries</h3>
<p>If people pleasing seems like a virtue to you, consider Jesus’ stance on the topic.</p>
<p>He was compassionate and served others wholly and perfectly. He wept with those who grieved and loved the unlovable. But what He didn’t do was to cater to them. He didn’t adjust His mission or His message to keep others comfortable. Jesus left the crowds to withdraw and rest.</p>
<p>If Jesus Himself modeled a life that was constructed of healthy boundaries, clarity, and authenticity, why would people-pleasing be the right lifestyle for His followers?</p>
<h3>When Therapy Becomes Necessary</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21589" height="300" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/kristyna-squared-one-eIK9LC6qKjA-unsplash-1-300x300.jpg" width="300" />People-pleasing is often rooted in early experiences or trauma. Maybe you grew up in a home where conflict was dangerous or where love had to be earned. Or maybe being “easy to be around” got you praise, and speaking your mind resulted in punishment.</p>
<p>These early established patterns can take root in every part of your being. They are tied to your emotions and relationships and can even influence neurological pathways. God gives us a way out of these deeply ingrained influences. Scripture gives us wisdom and truth on the topic, but sometimes therapy can help you learn how to apply that truth in specific and personal ways, unique to your life.</p>
<p>A good Christian therapist will honor your values and help you identify your triggers for saying “yes” when you would rather say “no” and uncover the hidden fears that motivate you. They can also help you practice assertiveness in a safe and manageable way, where there are no consequences, and help you build a healthier view of your worth.</p>
<h3>Speaking your mind makes you authentic</h3>
<p>Many people-pleasers are afraid to speak their mind. They think that being honest and authentic will make them sound rude or selfish. They worry that people won’t like the “real” them, so they do what they have been groomed to do: agree and not make any “waves.”</p>
<p>So, with a nod and a smile, they utter phrases like, “I’m fine with anything.” Deep down, they fear that if they say what they really want, people won’t like them, and if they show their real selves, people will just walk away.</p>
<p>This fear often runs deep and is rooted in deeply set insecurities. But it is also baseless.</p>
<p>Speaking your mind is not rude; it is authentic and transparent. Real people are magnetic! There’s something deeply attractive about someone who knows what they think, says it plainly, and doesn’t twist themselves to fit everyone else’s comfort. The people around you may not always agree with you, but chances are that they will respect you.</p>
<p>People-pleasers, in all their attempts to be agreeable, often appear incredibly fake to those around them. When someone agrees with everything, never has a preference, and constantly avoids conflict, those around them do not truly connect with them as a person.</p>
<p>They’re actually connecting with that person’s fear response. Most people are attracted to truth. They want clarity and relationships where no one is guessing how the other person is feeling or what they are thinking, or walking on eggshells.</p>
<p>A strong person can say, “I disagree” with you without hostility and can say “no” without guilt. Strong people are not necessarily harsh, but steady, grounded, and clear. They can say, “This is what I need” without the urge to apologize. That type of person comes across as trustworthy, and with them, you know exactly where you stand.</p>
<h3>Letting God Define Love</h3>
<p>At the core, people-pleasing is all about control. If you’re a people pleaser, you are trying to manage how others see you, how they respond to you, and how they treat you. It might feel safe, but it’s actually a quiet, less obvious form of manipulation. You aren’t giving people the full truth about yourself. You’re giving them what you think they want to avoid discomfort, rejection, or disapproval.</p>
<p>God wants you to walk in truth and love. And the truth is, sometimes love says no. Sometimes it disappoints people, and sometimes it even lets someone else feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Encouragement for the Future</h3>
<p>If you are in relationships that feel toxic due to your need to people-please, realize that it’s not too late to change the dynamic.</p>
<p>You don’t have to flip the switch overnight, but you can start to make small changes that will help you find a more balanced relationship. Start by saying what you want to eat for dinner, or let a voicemail go unanswered. Be brave enough to cancel plans that you said “yes” to out of guilt, and little by little, those small acts of honest bravery can turn into a life of integrity.</p>
<p>From that new place in your life, you will attract more genuine friendships that are built on mutual respect, and you may even discover confidence that you didn’t know was buried under all your need for compliance.</p>
<p>Becoming a recovering people-pleaser does not require you to become harsh or mean, but it does require you to realize that your voice and opinion matter and that you’re an important member of God’s family.</p>

<p>People pleasers don’t want to upset anyone, so they say “yes” to everything. They go along with the group plans even when they are uncomfortable. They apologize even when they’ve done nothing wrong. Underneath all those yeses and sorries is often the quiet belief that if they keep everyone happy, they’ll be liked and admired.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that isn’t usually the case. The opposite is often true. Fear-based kindness is a breeding ground for unhealthy, toxic relationships.</p>
<p>The Scripture even warns about trying to please people. In Proverbs 29:25, it says, “The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe.” Fear of people’s disapproval creates a trap. It pulls you into relationships that are one-sided and manipulative. Sadly, it invites the very thing you were trying to avoid, like rejection, disrespect, and emotional fatigue.</p>
<h3>Toxic people are drawn to people pleasers</h3>
<p>Manipulators are drawn to people who don’t push back against their aggression. They are drawn to people who over-apologize and who want to keep the peace so badly that they tolerate anything, even being disrespected.</p>
<p>To a toxic person, a passive people-pleaser appears to be the ideal friend. They love to attach themselves to someone who will offer them no resistance, confrontation, or challenge. And what the people-pleaser themselves see as “easygoing” is an open invitation to toxic people for misuse.</p>
<h3>The Message People Pleasing Conveys</h3>
<p>Saying “Whatever you want” repeatedly sounds harmless, even cooperative, but it communicates a negative message. It is telling the other person in your life that your voice doesn’t matter, that they get to decide everything, and that their needs come before your own. It teaches others to stop asking for your input and to assume that you really don’t care.</p>
<p>Eventually, people stop seeing you as a whole person with needs and preferences of your own. You are reduced to the role of helper, fixer, and emotional support person, but not a person with equality. People pleasing keeps you in quiet frustration and blinds everyone else to your needs.</p>
<h3>Even Jesus had boundaries</h3>
<p>If people pleasing seems like a virtue to you, consider Jesus’ stance on the topic.</p>
<p>He was compassionate and served others wholly and perfectly. He wept with those who grieved and loved the unlovable. But what He didn’t do was to cater to them. He didn’t adjust His mission or His message to keep others comfortable. Jesus left the crowds to withdraw and rest.</p>
<p>If Jesus Himself modeled a life that was constructed of healthy boundaries, clarity, and authenticity, why would people-pleasing be the right lifestyle for His followers?</p>
<h3>When Therapy Becomes Necessary</h3>
<p>People-pleasing is often rooted in early experiences or trauma. Maybe you grew up in a home where conflict was dangerous or where love had to be earned. Or maybe being “easy to be around” got you praise, and speaking your mind resulted in punishment.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-25992 alignleft" height="300" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/kristyna-squared-one-eIK9LC6qKjA-unsplash-1-300x300.jpg" width="300" />These early established patterns can take root in every part of your being. They are tied to your emotions and relationships and can even influence neurological pathways. God gives us a way out of these deeply ingrained influences. Scripture gives us wisdom and truth on the topic, but sometimes therapy can help you learn how to apply that truth in specific and personal ways, unique to your life.</p>
<p>A good Christian therapist will honor your values and help you identify your triggers for saying “yes” when you would rather say “no” and uncover the hidden fears that motivate you. They can also help you practice assertiveness in a safe and manageable way, where there are no consequences, and help you build a healthier view of your worth.</p>
<h3>Speaking your mind makes you authentic</h3>
<p>Many people-pleasers are afraid to speak their mind. They think that being honest and authentic will make them sound rude or selfish. They worry that people won’t like the “real” them, so they do what they have been groomed to do: agree and not make any “waves.”</p>
<p>So, with a nod and a smile, they utter phrases like, “I’m fine with anything.” Deep down, they fear that if they say what they really want, people won’t like them, and if they show their real selves, people will just walk away.</p>
<p>This fear often runs deep and is rooted in deeply set insecurities. But it is also baseless.</p>
<p>Speaking your mind is not rude; it is authentic and transparent. Real people are magnetic! There’s something deeply attractive about someone who knows what they think, says it plainly, and doesn’t twist themselves to fit everyone else’s comfort. The people around you may not always agree with you, but chances are that they will respect you.</p>
<p>People-pleasers, in all their attempts to be agreeable, often appear incredibly fake to those around them. When someone agrees with everything, never has a preference, and constantly avoids conflict, those around them do not truly connect with them as a person.</p>
<p>They’re actually connecting with that person’s fear response. Most people are attracted to truth. They want clarity and relationships where no one is guessing how the other person is feeling or what they are thinking, or walking on eggshells.</p>
<p>A strong person can say, “I disagree” with you without hostility and can say “no” without guilt. Strong people are not necessarily harsh, but steady, grounded, and clear. They can say, “This is what I need” without the urge to apologize. That type of person comes across as trustworthy, and with them, you know exactly where you stand.</p>
<h3>Letting God Define Love</h3>
<p>At the core, people-pleasing is all about control. If you’re a people pleaser, you are trying to manage how others see you, how they respond to you, and how they treat you. It might feel safe, but it’s actually a quiet, less obvious form of manipulation. You aren’t giving people the full truth about yourself. You’re giving them what you think they want to avoid discomfort, rejection, or disapproval.</p>
<p>God wants you to walk in truth and love. And the truth is, sometimes love says no. Sometimes it disappoints people, and sometimes it even lets someone else feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Encouragement for the Future</h3>
<p>If you are in relationships that feel toxic due to your need to people-please, realize that it’s not too late to change the dynamic.</p>
<p>You don’t have to flip the switch overnight, but you can start to make small changes that will help you find a more balanced relationship. Start by saying what you want to eat for dinner, or let a voicemail go unanswered. Be brave enough to cancel plans that you said “yes” to out of guilt, and little by little, those small acts of honest bravery can turn into a life of integrity.</p>
<p>From that new place in your life, you will attract more genuine friendships that are built on mutual respect, and you may even discover confidence that you didn’t know was buried under all your need for compliance.</p>
<p>Becoming a recovering people-pleaser does not require you to become harsh or mean, but it does require you to realize that your voice and opinion matter and that you’re an important member of God’s family.</p>

<p>People-pleasers, in all their attempts to be agreeable, often appear incredibly fake to those around them. When someone agrees with everything, never has a preference, and constantly avoids conflict, those around them do not truly connect with them as a person.</p>
<p>They’re actually connecting with that person’s fear response. Most people are attracted to truth. They want clarity and relationships where no one is guessing how the other person is feeling or what they are thinking, or walking on eggshells.</p>
<p>A strong person can say, “I disagree” with you without hostility and can say “no” without guilt. Strong people are not necessarily harsh, but steady, grounded, and clear. They can say, “This is what I need” without the urge to apologize. That type of person comes across as trustworthy, and with them, you know exactly where you stand.</p>
<h3>Letting God Define Love</h3>
<p>At the core, people-pleasing is all about control. If you’re a people pleaser, you are trying to manage how others see you, how they respond to you, and how they treat you. It might feel safe, but it’s actually a quiet, less obvious form of manipulation. You aren’t giving people the full truth about yourself. You’re giving them what you think they want to avoid discomfort, rejection, or disapproval.</p>
<p>God wants you to walk in truth and love. And the truth is, sometimes love says no. Sometimes it disappoints people, and sometimes it even lets someone else feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Encouragement for the Future</h3>
<p>If you are in relationships that feel toxic due to your need to people-please, realize that it’s not too late to change the dynamic.</p>
<p>You don’t have to flip the switch overnight, but you can start to make small changes that will help you find a more balanced relationship. Start by saying what you want to eat for dinner, or let a voicemail go unanswered. Be brave enough to cancel plans that you said “yes” to out of guilt, and little by little, those small acts of honest bravery can turn into a life of integrity.</p>
<p>From that new place in your life, you will attract more genuine friendships that are built on mutual respect, and you may even discover confidence that you didn’t know was buried under all your need for compliance.</p>
<p>Becoming a recovering people-pleaser does not require you to become harsh or mean, but it does require you to realize that your voice and opinion matter and that you’re an important member of God’s family.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Being agreeable sounds like a good thing, right? In fact, as a child, you were probably told to “just get along” with your siblings or to “just go with the flow” during family vacation. Being agreeable can be a good thing and often appears to be humility and love, but for people pleasers, the motive isn’t love at all; it’s fear.</p>
<p>People pleasers don’t want to upset anyone, so they say “yes” to everything. They go along with the group plans even when they are uncomfortable. They apologize even when they’ve done nothing wrong. Underneath all those yeses and sorries is often the quiet belief that if they keep everyone happy, they’ll be liked and admired.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that isn’t usually the case. The opposite is often true. Fear-based kindness is a breeding ground for unhealthy, toxic relationships.</p>
<p>The Scripture even warns about trying to please people. In Proverbs 29:25, it says, “The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe.” Fear of people’s disapproval creates a trap. It pulls you into relationships that are one-sided and manipulative. Sadly, it invites the very thing you were trying to avoid, like rejection, disrespect, and emotional fatigue.</p>
<h3>Toxic people are drawn to people pleasers</h3>
<p>Manipulators are drawn to people who don’t push back against their aggression. They are drawn to people who over-apologize and who want to keep the peace so badly that they tolerate anything, even being disrespected.</p>
<p>To a toxic person, a passive people-pleaser appears to be the ideal friend. They love to attach themselves to someone who will offer them no resistance, confrontation, or challenge. And what the people-pleaser themselves see as “easygoing” is an open invitation to toxic people for misuse.</p>
<h3>The Message People Pleasing Conveys</h3>
<p>Saying “Whatever you want” repeatedly sounds harmless, even cooperative, but it communicates a negative message. It is telling the other person in your life that your voice doesn’t matter, that they get to decide everything, and that their needs come before your own. It teaches others to stop asking for your input and to assume that you really don’t care.</p>
<p>Eventually, people stop seeing you as a whole person with needs and preferences of your own. You are reduced to the role of helper, fixer, and emotional support person, but not a person with equality. People pleasing keeps you in quiet frustration and blinds everyone else to your needs.</p>
<h3>Even Jesus had boundaries</h3>
<p>If people pleasing seems like a virtue to you, consider Jesus’ stance on the topic.</p>
<p>He was compassionate and served others wholly and perfectly. He wept with those who grieved and loved the unlovable. But what He didn’t do was to cater to them. He didn’t adjust His mission or His message to keep others comfortable. Jesus left the crowds to withdraw and rest.</p>
<p>If Jesus Himself modeled a life that was constructed of healthy boundaries, clarity, and authenticity, why would people-pleasing be the right lifestyle for His followers?</p>
<h3>When Therapy Becomes Necessary</h3>
<p>People-pleasing is often rooted in early experiences or trauma. Maybe you grew up in a home where conflict was dangerous or where love had to be earned. Or maybe being “easy to be around” got you praise, and speaking your mind resulted in punishment.</p>
<img alt="How Being a People Pleaser Can Invite Toxic Friendships 1" class="alignleft wp-image-57329" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-being-a-people-pleaser-can-invite-toxic-friendships-2-500x500.jpg" width="300" />These early established patterns can take root in every part of your being. They are tied to your emotions and relationships and can even influence neurological pathways. God gives us a way out of these deeply ingrained influences. Scripture gives us wisdom and truth on the topic, but sometimes therapy can help you learn how to apply that truth in specific and personal ways, unique to your life.</p>
<p>A good Christian therapist will honor your values and help you identify your triggers for saying “yes” when you would rather say “no” and uncover the hidden fears that motivate you. They can also help you practice assertiveness in a safe and manageable way, where there are no consequences, and help you build a healthier view of your worth.</p>
<h3>Speaking your mind makes you authentic</h3>
<p>Many people-pleasers are afraid to speak their mind. They think that being honest and authentic will make them sound rude or selfish. They worry that people won’t like the “real” them, so they do what they have been groomed to do: agree and not make any “waves.”</p>
<p>So, with a nod and a smile, they utter phrases like, “I’m fine with anything.” Deep down, they fear that if they say what they really want, people won’t like them, and if they show their real selves, people will just walk away.</p>
<p>This fear often runs deep and is rooted in deeply set insecurities. But it is also baseless.</p>
<p>Speaking your mind is not rude; it is authentic and transparent. Real people are magnetic! There’s something deeply attractive about someone who knows what they think, says it plainly, and doesn’t twist themselves to fit everyone else’s comfort. The people around you may not always agree with you, but chances are that they will respect you.</p>
<p>People-pleasers, in all their attempts to be agreeable, often appear incredibly fake to those around them. When someone agrees with everything, never has a preference, and constantly avoids conflict, those around them do not truly connect with them as a person.</p>

<title>The Power of an Apology for Boosting High EQ in Kids</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Parents are always busy teaching kids essential life skills, like how to share, please and thank you, and working hard at schoolwork. Sadly, there’s one simple lesson that’s easy to overlook, and that’s the power of saying “I’m sorry.” It might seem like a small thing, but learning to apologize is actually a huge part of developing emotional intelligence or a high EQ (emotional quotient).</p>
<p>When we talk about emotional intelligence, we’re talking about the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our emotions, as well as the ability to connect with and empathize with others. Apologizing teaches this exact skill, understanding when our actions hurt someone, acknowledging it, and offering a sincere apology.</p>
<p>Apologizing is one of the most powerful gifts we can give our children to help them grow emotionally. It may surprise you just how much the simple act of saying “I’m sorry” impacts your child’s emotional well-being. It will stick with them for life.</p>
<h3>How High EQ in Kids Differs from Adults</h3>
<p>When we think of emotional intelligence, it can be easy to imagine adults with well-developed social and emotional skills. However, when it comes to kids, high EQ often looks a little different. While adults tend to have more refined emotional skills, kids are just beginning to understand their feelings and how to manage them.</p>
<img alt="The Power of an Apology for Boosting High EQ in Kids" class="alignleft wp-image-36263" height="169" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-power-of-an-apology-for-boosting-high-eq-in-kids-500x281.jpg" width="300" />That’s why emotional intelligence in kids looks a little different than it does in adults. For children, it might mean being able to recognize, name their emotions, and express them by saying something like “I feel mad” or “I’m sad.” As they grow, they learn to empathize with others and realize how their actions impact the people around them.</p>
<p>With time, these skills grow and become more complex, just as they do in adults. When we start cultivating these emotional skills early on, we set our kids up for future success in both their personal relationships and professional lives.</p>
<h3>Learning to Admit We Make Mistakes, Too</h3>
<p>Many times we want to be perfect role models for our kids, showing them the way and guiding them with our wisdom. The simple truth is that we, too, as adults, make mistakes. When we own up to them and apologize, we set an incredible example for our children. Apologizing doesn’t show weakness; it shows humility, vulnerability, and accountability.</p>
<p>When we admit our mistakes and apologize, we teach our children that it’s okay to be imperfect. We give them permission to acknowledge their own missteps and grow from them. By admitting when we’re wrong, we teach our children the importance of accountability, setting aside any pride. If they see us doing this, it opens the door for them to feel comfortable doing the same. This act of vulnerability and openness is a big part of developing high EQ.</p>
<p>The Bible has so many deeply moving stories of apology and reconciliation that offer powerful lessons in emotional intelligence. These examples show us that apologizing isn’t just a way to mend personal relationships, it’s also a means of fostering forgiveness, healing, and growth.</p>
<h3>Famous Apologies from the Bible</h3>
<p><em>King David’s Apology to God</em>
<p>When King David committed adultery with Bathsheba and arranged for her husband, Uriah, to be killed in battle, he sinned greatly. However, when the prophet Nathan confronted him, David immediately acknowledged his wrongdoing. In 2 Samuel 12:13, he says, “I have sinned against the Lord.”</p>
<p>This simple, yet heartfelt apology shows us the power of confessing our mistakes and seeking forgiveness. David’s remorse was not just about admitting he was wrong, it was a deep acknowledgment of his sin and his desire for reconciliation with God.</p>
<p><em><img alt="The Power of an Apology for Boosting High EQ in Kids 1" class="alignright wp-image-36264" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-power-of-an-apology-for-boosting-high-eq-in-kids-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Jacob’s Apology to Esau</em></p>
<p>After years of estrangement due to Jacob’s deception and theft of Esau’s birthright and blessing, Jacob humbly seeks reconciliation with his brother Esau. In Genesis 33:1-11, when the two brothers finally meet, Jacob bows down seven times to show respect and humility before his brother, acknowledging the wrongs he had done.</p>
<p>Jacob, though not saying the words “I’m sorry,” expresses a deep desire for reconciliation by offering gifts to Esau and showing remorse for how he treated him.</p>
<p>Esau, in turn, forgives Jacob, and they embrace. In this case, the action of Jacob humbling himself and seeking to restore the broken relationship speaks volumes about the importance of humility, accountability, and emotional intelligence, especially between older and younger siblings.</p>
<p>While the word sorry is powerful on its own, there are many other simple affirmations that can significantly boost high EQ in kids. By always making a habit of validating kids’ feelings and encouraging empathy, we teach our children how to process and manage emotions in healthy ways.</p>
<h3>Other Positive Affirmations that Boost High EQ in Kids</h3>
<p><strong>“I may not understand exactly how you feel, but I am here for you.”</strong></p>
<p>Acknowledging a child’s emotions shows empathy for them and helps them feel heard. When children feel validated, they’re more likely to open up and express themselves.</p>
<p><strong>“It’s okay to feel this way.”</strong></p>
<p>By normalizing emotions like anger, sadness, or frustration, you help your child understand that all feelings are natural and not something to be ashamed of.</p>
<p><strong>“I believe in you.”</strong></p>
<p>This phrase builds up a child’s confidence and builds their self-esteem. Emotionally intelligent people believe in their abilities. Your child will too if they hear this regularly, which is a big part of high EQ.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="The Power of an Apology for Boosting High EQ in Kids 2" class="alignleft wp-image-36265" height="300" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-power-of-an-apology-for-boosting-high-eq-in-kids-3-333x500.jpg" width="200" />“Let’s work through this together.”</strong></p>
<p>This statement builds upon problem-solving and cooperation. Encouraging your child to work with you on resolving conflicts builds teamwork and communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>“Thank you for sharing your feelings with me.”</strong></p>
<p>Acknowledging your child’s vulnerability in expressing their emotions encourages more open communication, laying the groundwork for a healthier emotional environment. Expressing gratitude for emotional openness reinforces the importance of communication and emotional honesty.</p>
<p>All of these types of positive affirmations can be just as impactful as teaching your child how to apologize. Together, they foster high EQ, emotional resilience, and strong interpersonal skills.</p>
<p>How do you go from not apologizing to having it become a part of your daily lives? Teaching your child to apologize doesn’t have to be a boring lecture. There are creative, engaging ways to make it fun while still boosting their high EQ.</p>
<h3>Fun Ways to Teach Apologies and Boost High EQ in Kids</h3>
<p><strong>Role-playing Games</strong></p>
<p>Create imaginary scenarios where your child can practice apologizing, whether it’s with a sibling or a parent. You can even take on different characters to make it feel more like a fun challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Apology Cards</strong></p>
<p>Have your child draw or write apology cards for times they need to say sorry. This turns the act of apologizing into a creative, personal gesture and helps them understand the importance of sincerity.</p>
<p><strong>Emotion Charades</strong></p>
<p>Play a game where your child gets to act out different emotions instead of saying their feelings out loud. This helps them better understand their own feelings and learn how to express them.</p>
<p><strong>Storytime Discussions</strong></p>
<p>Read books that include apologies and have discussions about how characters handle their mistakes. This provides valuable insights for your child on how to approach similar situations in their own lives.</p>
<p><strong>Apology Journal</strong></p>
<p>Encourage your child to keep a journal where they write about times they’ve apologized and how it made them feel. Looking back on these moments shows them how to reflect and the value of emotional responsibility.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="The Power of an Apology for Boosting High EQ in Kids 3" class="alignright wp-image-36266" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/the-power-of-an-apology-for-boosting-high-eq-in-kids-4-500x333.jpg" width="300" /></strong>These activities turn the process of learning to apologize into a fun and memorable experience while nurturing high EQ along the way. Incorporating a simple sorry into your parenting toolbox is one of the most impactful ways to nurture high EQ. Apologizing helps children develop empathy, accountability, and emotional resilience, all skills they’ll need throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Also, by using biblical examples like King David, the prodigal son, and Joseph’s forgiveness, we can show our kids how profound and transformative apologies can be in healing relationships.</p>
<p>If you need additional guidance on nurturing emotional intelligence in your child, compassionate family counselors are available to support you. Together, they can help your child grow into an emotionally intelligent and resilient person, ready to face the world with empathy, understanding, and a big heart.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Many things are good and helpful in moderation, but bad and destructive in excess. One of those things is anger, which is a natural human emotion that we’ve all felt at one point or another in our lives. Maybe you last got angry when you felt that the wrong politician got voted in, or when someone was late to a meeting and didn’t apologize, or when your children sassed you. Whatever the occasion, we’ve all felt anger in one form or another.</p>
<p>While anger is natural and a part of our lives, it can become uncontrollable, or you might struggle to find healthy ways to express it. When this happens, you are at risk of damaging your career, relationships, and mental, physical, and emotional well-being. Christian therapy for anger management offers you tools and a holistic way to understand, manage, and articulate your anger in a healthy way.</p>
<p>If you struggle with anger, it’s important to understand the options available to you to address your concerns. Therapy for anger management can help you, and this article will walk you through what it is, how it works, and some of the techniques you’ll learn to help you regain control over your anger.</p>
<h3>Therapy for Anger Management: What is it?</h3>
<p>Anger management therapy or counseling is a form of counseling that’s designed to help an individual discern the signs of their anger and recognize what triggers their anger. Bottling up, ignoring, or acting out to express anger are just some examples of unhealthy ways of dealing with anger. When you pretend you aren’t angry, or you suppress those feelings in an act of misguided Christian charity, that isn’t handling anger well.</p>
<p>Anger management therapy focuses on helping you acknowledge feelings of anger, recognizing that anger is a valid emotion to both feel and experience. Often, we feel angry when our boundaries have been violated. This matters because our boundaries demarcate our limits and who we are as people. To deny your anger is, in a sense, to deny yourself and what matters to you.</p>
<p>God refines who we are and the things that matter to us as He makes us more like Christ (1 John 3:2; Ephesians 4:1-16). Getting there doesn’t entail denying that you’re angry, but rather by learning to take on the Lord’s priorities, having our mind transformed, and learning to respond to anger (and other everyday realities) constructively and in a godly way (Romans 12:1-2; Ephesians 4:17-32).</p>
<img alt="Therapy for Anger Management: Finding Your Path to Emotional Well-being" class="alignleft wp-image-36258" height="300" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/therapy-for-anger-management-finding-your-path-to-emotional-well-being-375x500.jpg" width="225" />Therapists use techniques tailored to meet the individual’s needs. These include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps you to identify and reframe negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with anger. They can also use breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation to foster relaxation and calm the mind.</p>
<p>Other techniques that a therapist might use include helping you strengthen your communication skills. With help, you can learn to be assertive and clear in your communication without being aggressive. Skills such as problem-solving, conflict resolution, and active listening can help you avoid jumping to conclusions or assuming motives. These are the reasons why anger often flares up in various situations.</p>
<h3>How Anger Management Therapy Works</h3>
<p>When you go for anger management therapy, what exactly happens? The sessions for anger management therapy will use approaches that address not only the way you behave, but the way you think as well. Your therapist or counselor will talk with you to understand your life story and the various ways anger shows up in your life.</p>
<p>The process aims to identify the root causes of anger, which may be the result of unresolved trauma, chronic stress, frustration with your current circumstances, or underlying psychological conditions such as depression or bipolar disorder. Assessing the potential root of anger problems may begin earlier with a visit to a physician who might identify or eliminate some possibilities.</p>
<p>Every person has their unique triggers that make them angry. Through conversation, your therapist will work closely with you to help you recognize your triggers, and that means knowing what situations or thoughts tend to provoke your anger. Taking the time to do this can help you zero in on the root cause and equip you to respond constructively because you know ahead of time what typically makes you angry.</p>
<p>Aside from recognizing your own triggers, whether it’s not being listened to or feeling like you’re being taken advantage of, your therapist can help you identify your own early warning signs that you’re getting angry.</p>
<p>In your case, it could be that you feel flushed, or your heart starts to pound in your chest and ears, or you begin clenching your fists or jaw, or you feel irritated. Being attuned to these helps you remain aware of your emotional and cognitive state.</p>
<p>Your therapist will also help you to develop healthy coping strategies so that you learn to manage your anger and how you react, whether before your anger escalates or in the moment when anger threatens to get the better of you. These coping strategies can mean the difference between having a constructive conversation and things taking a turn for the worse because of harsh words spoken in haste.</p>
<p>Therapy for anger management often takes place in a one-to-one setting, with just you and your therapist. However, it can take place in other contexts, and it’s up to you to decide the best option.</p>
<p>The therapy can happen in a group with several individuals and be led by one or two therapists who guide the conversation. They will elicit helpful contributions from group members as they share their experiences and effective strategies to handle anger.</p>
<p><img alt="Therapy for Anger Management: Finding Your Path to Emotional Well-being 1" class="alignright wp-image-36259" height="169" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/therapy-for-anger-management-finding-your-path-to-emotional-well-being-2-500x281.jpg" width="300" />Family therapy is another context to address anger issues. Anger issues might be rooted in the dynamics in the family, such as favoritism or abuse. Participating in therapy as a family helps identify these dynamics. It can also help a family become a source of mutual support rather than one of stress.</p>
<p>Anger therapy can also happen with couples. Doing such therapy together helps the couple to grow in understanding important matters like each other’s communication style as well as anger triggers. The couple can be equipped to support each other, communicate more effectively, and deal with anger constructively and with more grace.</p>
<h3>The Goals of Anger Management Therapy</h3>
<p>When you go for therapy to manage anger, it’s important to know what the goal of the therapy is and what you’re working toward. The aim isn’t to eliminate anger from a person’s life, but rather, the goals of the therapy include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Improve relationships</strong> Through therapy, you should be able to communicate your feelings effectively without resorting to aggression. This will have the benefit of improving your relationships with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Gain control over anger</strong> Therapy will help you develop the capacity to respond to your anger triggers in healthier, more constructive ways. In other words, instead of being controlled by your anger, you remain in the driver’s seat and use anger meaningfully.</p>
<p><strong>Enhance self-awareness</strong> Through therapy, you’ll gain deeper personal insight, allowing you to understand your unique thought patterns that tend to fuel anger. Some people struggle with catastrophizing or jumping to conclusions. When you know this is your tendency, you can identify these patterns and disrupt them before they take hold and lead you down a dark path.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce physical and emotional distre</strong><strong>ss</strong> Unbridled anger can damage a person’s well-being. It can increase the risk of cardiac issues, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system, in addition to damaging relationships with others. Therapy can reduce or minimize the harmful effects that unmanaged anger can have on one’s mental and physical health.</p>
<p>Anger management therapy is important because it can help you regain control over your life and resolve issues more amicably. This can foster not only healthier relationships with others, but better mental, emotional, and physical health for yourself. Therapy isn’t a quick fix, as it often has to undo patterns that took years to develop. With professional help, you can grow and learn to manage your anger well.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about how anger management therapy can help you, contact the office. They can connect you with a therapist to process anger and learn strategies to overcome your struggle.</p>

<title>I Am Angry: What Now?</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>You might have uttered these words (or thought them): “I am angry.” So, how do you know what to do next?</p>
<p>Maybe it was something your spouse did but forgot to run by you. Or perhaps one of your children failed to do something they said they would. It could be a work-related trigger: a sudden deadline, a criticism from a co-worker, or a pay cut. Whatever the anger triggers, believe it or not, it’s what follows that matters.</p>
<p>Here’s what comes next.</p>
<h3>“I am angry” receives acknowledgement</h3>
<p>We sometimes think our best recourse when a negative emotion pops up is to ignore it. We scroll through our phone, find a snack, jump in the car to leave, or turn on the television. But these are simply distractions from what’s essential about the anger we feel: admitting it.</p>
<p>Admitting to yourself, “I am angry,” is the kindest way to move forward. First, research indicates that acknowledging your negative emotions leads to fewer negative emotions. You’re essentially telling yourself that anger is simply where you’re at right now, and you don’t need to react.</p>
<img alt="I Am Angry: What Now?" class="alignleft wp-image-57318" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-500x333.jpg" width="300" />It’s like grabbing a map and finding the <em>You Are Here</em> square at the local shopping mall. There’s no shame in finding out where you are.</p>
<p>If you get into a pattern that communicates that negative emotions and thoughts are a part of life, you’re setting yourself up for a healthy habit. Here’s why. When you’re able to recognize the validity of negative emotions as part of a whole, authentic experience, you can also accept yourself fully without judgment. Then, you can move on to the next step.</p>
<h3>Reflection is essential</h3>
<p>Second, after you’ve acknowledged how you feel, you can consider what to do next. It may seem clear what your next step is, but now that you know what you’re feeling is anger, do you know why?</p>
<p>Evaluate what led to your anger and recognize that your anger may be deeper than the actual trigger. For example, if you found out that your spouse made a large purchase with the tax refund, anger may arise because you and your spouse have had trust issues in the past.</p>
<p><img alt="I Am Angry: What Now? 1" class="alignright wp-image-57319" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-2-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Perhaps you prefer to control the financial well-being of your household (which could stem from a lack of financial control in your family of origin), or you feel left out and neglected by your spouse since they didn’t discuss the purchase with you.</p>
<p>The second step is to ask yourself a question that helps you reflect on your anger. You can even have a fill-in-the-blank on your journal page: <em>I am angry because____</em> and complete the sentence. Then, ask yourself if that complete sentence tells the whole story.</p>
<p>Here is another example. If your sentence says something like, “I am angry because my son promised to take out the trash and clean his room, and he didn’t,” you may want to ask a follow-up question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does this make me angry?</li>
<li>Is it because I feel like the cleanliness of his room is a reflection of me as a parent?</li>
<li>Is it that my expectations weren’t met, and now I feel like the entire weight of our household chores fall on me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider what is beneath the anger and take some time to write about it if you can. If you’re driving or you don’t have time right now, open the recording app on your phone and talk freely. When we’re able to voice our emotions and distinguish between the emotional trigger and what’s beneath it, we’re on our way to releasing it.</p>
<h3>Let anger teach you</h3>
<p>Third, don’t fixate on the ins and outs of why you’re angry and try to solve it. For instance, if you are angry because of a relational conflict, you don’t have to fix it all right now. In fact, you might not be able to fix all of it. Instead, focus on what you can learn from your anger. It can be cognitively reframed to help you recognize when you’re making a quick assessment.</p>
<p>In the example of a child who didn’t do the chores as promised, your anger may make you realize you’re jumping to a conclusion. If there’s a compassionate reason behind one or more of the chores being left undone, you’ll know to ask questions and remain curious. This is beneficial in and of itself, even if there isn’t a logical reason for the undone chores. Still, you’ll have gained an emotional regulatory skill that benefits you in the long term.</p>
<p><img alt="I Am Angry: What Now? 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57320" height="217" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-3-500x361.jpg" width="300" />Instead of ruminating on why you’re upset or your expectations weren’t met, you can look for what the emotion is trying to communicate. That is the role that all emotions, whether we feel them as negative or positive, have in our lives. They tell us to pay attention.</p>
<p>Recognizing anger as a means of paying attention is a gift. You might need a few minutes to receive it as such, but the more often you recognize emotions as a communication tool, the better. You will be more likely to develop the positive habit of seeing what’s beneath the emotion rather than letting it distract you, lead you to cope in unhealthy ways, or place additional stress on relationships.</p>
<h3>Ask for help</h3>
<p>Another helpful step in knowing how to respond to anger is finding a counselor who can help you assess its function in your life.</p>
<p>Everyone gets angry. We wouldn’t be human if we didn’t. But not everyone responds to anger with unhealthy coping mechanisms or by raising their voice at anyone who will listen. This is why some drivers have road rage while others don’t. Sure, it’s frustrating when another driver cuts in front of you, but it doesn’t send everyone into an angry explosion that leads to reckless driving.</p>
<p>Having someone in your life who is a trained, licensed professional will help. They can give you confidence in areas where anger has taken you down paths you’d prefer not to go down. If you wish your anger could be better managed on a regular basis, or if you’ve made some mistakes due to anger before, let an outsider in.</p>
<p>Admitting to someone else, “I am angry,” is a vulnerable thing to do, but it’s also a healthy sign that you’re open to change. Being open to change means you are willing to be transformed by integrating new behavioral and relational tools into your everyday life.</p>
<p><img alt="I Am Angry: What Now? 3" class="alignright wp-image-57321" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-4-500x334.jpg" width="300" />A trained counselor will never judge you or shame your actions. His or her role is to help you gain perspective that’s difficult to see on your own. Everyone has blind spots, and anger may be covering some of yours. As you convey how you’re doing, a counselor can give you objective feedback based on compassionate care, aligning with your priorities.</p>
<p>Most people don’t set out to be angry, bitter, or resentful. Working through your negative emotions as they happen is a route toward forgiveness, freedom, and healthy relationships. You’ll be able to learn what your anger triggers are, some ways to cope with them that are beneficial and kind, and learn new habits to further your desire to be your best self.</p>
<p>In His kindness, the Bible tells us, God leads us to repentance. (Romans 2:4) This means that He not only sees when we are angry, but He highlights it so we’re aware of it. Why? So we can turn from unhelpful patterns to helpful ones.</p>
<p>While anger itself isn’t sinful, sometimes we cope with it through sinful habits. Any coping mechanism you might be using that ignores your love for God and doesn’t invite authenticity is just delaying what you likely already know: I am angry. Avoiding the emotion isn’t going to help. Instead, it can make anger more complex to manage.</p>
<p>Setting yourself up to manage anger in a healthy way will not be easy. It also won’t change overnight, particularly if it’s been a lifelong struggle. However, taking the steps to acknowledge it, reflect on why you’re angry, recognize what you can control or reframe, and find a trusted counselor to walk alongside you are all hope-filled ways to turn a new corner.</p>
<p>If you’d like to be matched with a counselor from one of our offices, we’re happy to help. Contact an office near you.</p>

<title>Healthy Ways to Adjust to Life After Divorce</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Life can take you on paths you never imagined traveling on. No one sets out to have their marriage end in divorce, for instance. Despite one’s best intentions, a marriage can find itself on the rocks and end in divorce. However you got there, once the divorce is finalized, you’re faced with the prospect of figuring out life in this new normal. There are various challenges and opportunities that this season affords you.</p>
<h3>Aspects of Life After Divorce</h3>
<p>Going through a divorce can be a stressful experience, even if you’re the one who initiated it or you’re certain it was the right decision. The experience of divorce and life after divorce can be challenging, but it can also be transformative. In a given moment, you may find yourself experiencing a wide array of emotions about the divorce, from peace, agitation, guilt, shame, fear, anxiety, or excitement.</p>
<p>We are multifaceted beings, and an experience like divorce will affect aspects of your life diversely. Emotionally, you may find yourself experiencing grief and needing healing. Feelings such as anger, sadness, relief, and guilt are part of the picture, and you should give yourself room to process these emotions. It’s a time to build and rely on your emotional resilience to cope with stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>You may also find the period after a divorce provides possibilities for self-discovery. Divorce brings about a shift in your relationships, and even in how you understand yourself and your identity. This new season has room for you to rediscover interests and hobbies you may have set aside, to rebuild your identity and define your values as an individual outside the marriage.</p>
<p>This season may also be one of personal growth. Apart from rediscovering hobbies and activities that bring you joy and fulfilment, one can also make new friendships, nurture old ones, and pursue personal development, whether that’s through further education, setting fresh career goals, or taking up initiatives that enhance your sense of well-being.</p>
<p>Divorce also changes your life in quite practical ways. You’ll need to make financial adjustments, such as starting to plan for your own financial stability and creating a new budget that reflects your circumstances. You’ll also need to manage shared expenses if there are children involved. You’ll also likely need to find and settle into a new home that fits your resources and needs.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of life after divorce, if children are involved, is the necessity of co-parenting. You and your former spouse must establish a collaborative and healthy relationship that focuses on your children’s needs and provides them with the support they need to flourish. Solo parenting has its challenges that you’ll need to adjust to.</p>
<p>Lastly, another facet of life after divorce is considering dating and relationships. Each individual needs to determine for themselves when it’s appropriate to form new connections, and what boundaries to set for themselves. Finding healing takes time and patience, and you shouldn’t rush into another relationship, especially if it’s only to numb feelings of pain or assuage anger.</p>
<h3>Challenges of Life After Divorce</h3>
<p>Going through a divorce is never easy or painless, even in situations where it’s amicable and not drawn out. There’s a financial, relational, emotional, physical, and spiritual cost to divorce. If you’re a believer, that may come with unique emotional and spiritual challenges, such as feelings of guilt and shame. You may feel like you’ve failed the Lord and your vows, and you might even experience a crisis of questioning the Lord’s love, presence, or plan.</p>
<p>While divorce is common, it still carries a sense of stigma in many communities of faith and families. You’ll have to deal with people’s perceptions, their reactions and judgment, and the strain on relationships with family members and friends that may occur. One possible outcome is experiencing social isolation if you lose your social and emotional support network. That can become another challenge to cope with after divorce.</p>
<p>Depending on how things worked in your marriage, divorce might mean needing to reenter the workforce to obtain an income. Other changes could include moving to a new home, not having contact with your child(ren) like before, lowering your living standard, and changing friendship circles as dynamics shift or things feel awkward. You may need to learn new skills to enable you to be independent, like household maintenance.</p>
<img alt="Healthy Ways to Adjust to Life After Divorce" class="alignleft wp-image-32802" height="200" src="https://lachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/healthy-ways-to-adjust-to-life-after-divorce-500x333.jpg" width="300" />In marriage, you make many compromises for the sake of the relationship, and rightly so. Every healthy relationship requires compromise by both parties. When the marriage ends, you could undergo a shift in your identity and how you perceive yourself. It can be challenging to rediscover who you are apart from the marriage, and to continue to preach the gospel to yourself, rooting your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>The grief and loss that often accompany divorce can be debilitating and hard to overcome. Even where it was absolutely the right and wise choice to leave the marriage, that doesn’t mean that the choice doesn’t come with loss.</p>
<p>The loss could be the end of your dreams and hopes for the relationship, or the loss of your sense of safety. Relationships can be traumatic, and you could be grieving the loss of yourself and your well-being because of the relationship.</p>
<h3>Things to Avoid After a Divorce</h3>
<p>The challenges that can arise after a divorce can be overwhelming and possibly derail you and your well-being if you don’t face them properly. There are things you can and should avoid after a divorce because they can prevent or delay your healing, your ability to maintain a healthy relationship with your ex, where that is necessary, and your ability to move on with your life.</p>
<p>Some things to avoid include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Negative self-talk</strong> A breakup is never easy, and you can slip into self-blame for what happened. There is a difference between accepting responsibility for your part in the breakdown of your marriage and descending into negative self-talk. The latter only leads to you feeling bad and not to concrete change. Instead of negative self-talk, practice self-compassion and place an emphasis on your personal growth.</p>
<p>In addition to negative self-talk, avoid ruminating over what has happened. Instead, focus on the present and your future. Give yourself the time you need to heal, and don’t set unrealistic expectations for yourself about what you can or should be accomplishing.</p>
<p><strong>Rebound relationships</strong> People who are hurting can find creative ways to address that hurt, but not all means are healthy. You must give yourself time to heal and work through the grief of your marriage before you commit to someone new. Another behavior to avoid is using a maladaptive coping mechanism like substance abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Co-parenting issues</strong> This is one of those areas where this verse is an apt challenge – “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone” (Romans 12:18, NIV). You should avoid co-parenting missteps, like arguing in front of the children or using your children as messengers. Address any issues privately with your co-parent and communicate directly with your ex as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Financial mistakes</strong> The process of getting divorced is often expensive, and you’ll need to adjust your spending afterwards. Create and stick to a budget that prioritizes stability, addresses joint financial obligations, and avoids impulsive spending.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid drama</strong> In our social media age, people would rather talk to their audience than speak directly to the person concerned. Posting things about your ex or divorce may be true to your lived experience, but it can complicate your situation unnecessarily by creating drama. There are other things you can make content about that don’t include this aspect of your life.</p>
<p>Going through a divorce can be taxing, physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. You must find healthy ways to deal with all this.</p>
<h3>Finding Support for Life After Divorce</h3>
<p>In addition to avoiding certain behaviors that undermine your well-being after divorce, there are things you can do to promote healing. It is vital that you take care of yourself through exercise, good sleep, nutrition, and connecting with loved ones as much as possible. Healing and restoration are possible, and the Lord doesn’t stop loving you because of divorce. Your identity and worth are rooted in Christ, something that cannot be shaken.</p>
<p>While looking to the future and not focusing on past regrets is important, working through your feelings toward the marriage and your experiences in that relationship is also important. You can seek help through individual or family counseling to help you process your thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>Post-divorce counseling or co-parenting therapy may also be helpful for you. These forms of therapy are especially helpful where you have complex co-parenting arrangements or if your divorce was mired in conflict. It helps you and your ex develop effective communication about raising your kids, addresses ongoing conflict, and can help reduce the stress and tension that can surround co-parenting.</p>
<p>If you’ve experienced divorce, reach out and speak with a counselor or therapist. They can help you to process your experience and learn how to cope well in its aftermath. Contact our office today to learn more.</p>

<title>A Different Perspective on Emotional Eating</title>
<link>https://texaschristiancounseling.com/articles/a-different-perspective-on-emotional-eating</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>For the past 60 years or more, our society and culture have been fixated on eating habits, body image, beauty standards, and physical health. There have been fluctuating trends through the decades. One thing that has remained consistent is that people have a lot to say about emotional eating, comfort eating, or stress eating.</p>
<p>Emotional eating is often regarded as a weakness or even a moral failure, especially when it centers around fast food or sugar-filled diets. Some go as far as to categorize emotional eating along with eating disorders, showing how misinformed they are on the topic.</p>
<p>While there are genuine concerns for national obesity and ailing health, people tend to focus on the wrong thing, creating more emotional issues and anxiety in the process. Every emotional eater is motivated by something. Sometimes they can be negative emotions, but other times, they are natural, harmless, and in some cases, positive, human, and beautiful.</p>
<p>There is a glorious combination of food, eating, community, and emotions that is at the core of so many of our experiences. Perhaps it is only when we begin to gain a different perspective on emotional eating that we will conquer some of the underlying issues that require more of our focus, like shame, guilt, and despair.</p>
<h3>A Different Perspective on Emotional Eating</h3>
<p>On the surface, eating and emotions seem to have little to do with each other. The only things they have in common are that everyone must eat to stay alive and everyone will experience emotions, some more frequently and more deeply than others. A person might ignore, repress, or misinterpret their emotions, but only people with an eating disorder will ignore, repress, or misinterpret their physical appetite.</p>
<p>Food and eating are an essential part of all of our lives, beyond the function of simply keeping our bodies fueled. Every person naturally develops a relationship with food and eating. This relationship can be good or bad, and many find it deeply connected to their emotional health.</p>
<p>Emotional eating is far more common than many people realize, and in many cases, far less of a threat or a concern. Behind every compulsion to overindulge or binge eat is an emotion that is being soothed, comforted, or regulated.</p>
<h3>It’s not just about negative emotions</h3>
<p>When most people hear the term <em>emotional eating</em>, they tend to imagine emotions like sadness, anxiety, or stress. Emotional eating is frequently referred to as stress eating or comfort eating. This implies that we eat because we are distressed, and treat food like a medicine for an ailment. However, emotional eating is about positive emotions, too. Emotional eating is part of everyone’s life, whether they realize it or not.</p>
<p>At almost every wedding, there is an elaborate meal with multiple courses, and a cake as the centerpiece attraction. The same happens at birthday parties, where people enjoy and indulge in the food options. Foods like hot dogs, burgers, and pizzas are an integral part of sporting events and national holidays.</p>
<img alt="A Different Perspective on Emotional Eating" class="alignleft wp-image-36250" height="240" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/a-different-perspective-on-emotional-eating-500x400.jpg" width="300" />Yes, emotional eating is often about coping with stress and sadness, but it is also an essential ingredient of celebration, enjoyment, and home comforts. Emotional eating teaches us about how we handle emotions.</p>
<p>The fact that we naturally have a negative connotation toward emotional eating shows how poorly we understand and deal with emotions. We have separated a wide variety of emotions into two small categories, and judged people for feeling one type of emotion, while praising them for feeling another set of emotions. This is more problematic than emotional eating.</p>
<h3>It’s the framework of many cultures and personal histories</h3>
<p>Not only is emotional eating a part of the national experience in our celebrations and enjoyment, but it is a rich part of the many cultures and personal family histories. It is an emotional thing to cook and eat a family meal whose recipe has been passed down through the generations. It’s about the older generations passing knowledge onto the next generation.</p>
<p>Young adults feel accomplished and that much more independent each time they successfully add a new recipe to their repertoire. Not everyone has these kinds of positive connections between family and food, but for those who do, emotional eating is a part of their identity and heritage.</p>
<h3>It’s about regulating and co-regulating our emotions</h3>
<p>It’s not only the food that is a core component of our culture, faith, and identity. It is the community we share through eating together. When we eat, we experience feel-good hormones like dopamine, endorphins, serotonin, and oxytocin. These hormones help enhance our mood and lift our energy. They can calm heated emotions like anger and anxiety, and lift heavy emotions like sadness and fear.</p>
<p>When we eat with a loved one or a group of friends, we experience a type of co-regulation of our moods. Emotional co-regulation is the friend who buys us dinner when we’re broke, or the neighbor who comes around with a homemade casserole to comfort us after we lose a loved one. In these cases, emotional eating communicates care and concern from those closest to us. We are joined in the simple and necessary act of eating together.</p>
<h3>It’s a form of self-protection and self-soothing</h3>
<p>We all develop a relationship with food and eating in our infancy, and that relationship naturally grows, develops, and deepens with time. Most children have a favorite food, and one that they completely despise and refuse to eat.</p>
<p><img alt="A Different Perspective on Emotional Eating 1" class="alignright wp-image-36251" height="225" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/a-different-perspective-on-emotional-eating-2-500x376.jpg" width="300" />Food is a tool for many parents, who know the quickest way to change a mood or reward good behavior is to bring out a treat. We form mental and emotional associations with food from a young age, and often keep those connections throughout our lives.</p>
<p>There are few things as comforting or exciting as finding a certain food from your childhood, or tasting a flavor from your past. In this way, emotional eating becomes a form of self-protection or self-soothing. It reminds us of a time when life was simpler or we were rewarded. We might gravitate to certain meals or particular foods and drinks unknowingly because they are a part of our personal history, and we subconsciously need the comfort they provide.</p>
<h3>It’s an eating behavior, not an eating disorder</h3>
<p>People who villainize the idea of emotional eating are often focused on the physical and medical effects of eating too much or eating unhealthy foods. Overindulgence and binge eating do affect our physical health, which can ultimately affect our self-esteem and confidence. However, it’s important to know that emotional eating on its own is not a disorder, but is simply a behavior.</p>
<p>Everyone has a unique relationship to food, which in some cases is part of a disorder that requires physical, mental, and emotional treatment. As of 2025, an estimated 9% of the population has dealt with an eating disorder at some point in their lives, with 0.3% currently dealing with a severe disorder like bulimia nervosa.</p>
<p>There are fewer statistics on emotional eating because it is not classified as an eating disorder. It is estimated, however, that one in five adults uses emotional eating as a form of coping and comfort.</p>
<h3>Emotional And Physical Health</h3>
<p>Even when emotional eating becomes problematic or a threat to physical health, it is not helped by shame, threats, or disgust. We need to be gentle with ourselves and kind to others, choosing our words carefully and offering our support instead of our judgment. We might have already spent too much time villainizing a behavior that is natural, human, healthy, harmless, and even beautiful.</p>
<p>Our relationship to food will not change until our relationship with ourselves begins to change. There are times when we need to feel comforted, soothed, and regulated in a way that we can only with food and community.</p>
<p>It takes years to fix a faulty relationship with food and self-image. In some cases, we can only be helped by therapy and counseling. If you would like to speak with a counselor about your eating habits and mental health, we can help. Contact us for more information.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In his book <em>The Four Loves, </em>C.S. Lewis wrote, “Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art&#8230; It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.” Our lives are made richer by our friendships, and they are sources of growth, joy, and mutual respect. These &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; relationships provide us with the support we need, making life a more beautiful venture.</p>
<p>While recognizing the value of friendships and how they nurture us, it’s also important to understand that things can and do go wrong in friendships. Boundaries can become blurred in those relationships, and emotional reliance on one another can become excessive. This has the potential to lead a relationship into codependency, which can strain and damage the relationship in the short and long term.</p>
<h3>Understanding Codependency in Friendships</h3>
<p>Friends rely on each other for a lot of things, including emotional support, encouragement, wisdom when making challenging decisions, and just enjoying life together. Through the many ups and downs that life presents, your friends are the people who go with you on that journey. This is how friendship works Mutual dependence between friends is one thing, but codependency goes over the line in a few significant ways.</p>
<p>So, what does codependency between friends look like? Codependency is an unhealthy emotional reliance on another person. This can look like one or both friends feeling like they are ultimately responsible for the other’s decisions, happiness, or sense of self-worth. No one can be responsible for another in the way a codependent relationship function.</p>
<img alt="How to Stem Codependency in Friendships" class="alignleft wp-image-36238" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-to-stem-codependency-in-friendships-500x333.jpg" width="300" />What happens in a codependent relationship is that the boundaries are blurred, and the two people become enmeshed in each other. They aren’t operating out of their sense of identity and individuality; instead, who they are becomes too closely tied to each other. They become too reliant on each other, being unable to function independently.</p>
<p>When and how does codependency begin in a friendship? Two friends can start on healthy footing, but things can change with time. Perhaps one friend gets into a jam, and the other helps them out, and that dynamic persists from there. One issue or situation becomes two or more, and the friendship can enter a pattern of codependency.</p>
<p>In many other cases, codependency is already lurking in the wings due to learned behaviors from one’s family dynamics. If one or both friends have unresolved emotional needs, past experiences of inconsistency or neglect in relationships, a fear of abandonment, and early patterns of caretaking, these can all play a part in the friendship becoming codependent. These patterns can inform the friendship and become how the friendship begins to operate.</p>
<p>A friendship can become codependent as the friends either consciously or unconsciously reinforce certain roles that may be familiar, but ultimately unhealthy. One might be used to being helped or rescued, while the other tends to swoop in and fix. This can be the prelude to the relationship drifting into codependency.</p>
<h3>Signs of Codependent Friendships</h3>
<p>Codependency can seem innocuous, like one friend who is stepping in to help the other, which has the potential to cause confusion. Isn’t that what friends are supposed to do? Aren’t friends supposed to experience what their counterpart feels? The problem with codependency is that it takes these natural impulses to help or assist and takes them up to an unhealthy level. So, how do we know if we are truly experiencing codependency in a friendship?</p>
<p>Here are some signs of codependency to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Exhaustion</strong><strong> </strong>or feeling drained after interactions with your friend, as though maintaining the friendship is a heavy obligation.</p>
<p><strong>Imbalanced Support </strong>or an unequal dynamic. In a codependent dynamic, one friend can assume the role of rescuer, while the other remains perpetually dependent. One finds themselves in trouble, and their friend will invariably step in to help them.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="How to Stem Codependency in Friendships 1" class="alignright wp-image-36239" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-to-stem-codependency-in-friendships-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />A Lack of Boundaries</strong> When a person has difficulty saying “no” to requests made of them, or they feel guilty when they set limits for themselves, that could be signs of codependency. This can present itself in a friendship if one finds themselves overcommitting themselves to meet their friend’s needs.</p>
<p><strong>A Constant Need for Approval</strong> Another sign of codependency is that one friend continually seeks validation from the other, and they have an increased fear of rejection or disapproval of their friend.</p>
<p><strong>Fear of Conflict</strong> One of the results of codependent behaviors is avoiding disagreements at all costs to maintain harmony, even if such avoidance leads to great personal discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Neglect</strong> Another sign of codependency is when an individual sacrifices their own well-being, interests, needs, or other relationships to prioritize their friend. Neglecting one’s own needs to meet another’s can be a sign of codependency.</p>
<p><strong>Over-Identifying</strong> When a friend defines their identity through the friendship, they may struggle to function independently. That might look like not being able to make decisions without the other person’s input, not being able to hold independent opinions, or have opinions that contradict their friend’s thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Being Possessive or Jealous</strong> Codependency could be at the root of feeling threatened by a friend’s other relationships or interests.</p>
<p><strong>Guilt-Based Obligations</strong> If you find yourself maintaining the friendship out of a sense of guilt rather than genuine connection or enjoyment, that could be an indicator of a codependent dynamic.</p>
<h3>How to Stem Codependency in Friendships</h3>
<p>A person who is experiencing a codependent friendship might experience significant strain in the relationship. Being friends with someone out of a sense of guilt, ignoring your needs to meet theirs, being controlled or feeling &#8220;managed&#8221; by your friend, and emotional exhaustion may all result in resentment, relationship burnout, and the sense that you’re losing yourself. However, all hope is not lost and there are some things that you can do to help your friendship.</p>
<p><strong>Self-reflect</strong> Our lives need self-examination to help us identify the areas where things might not be going well and providing space to self-correct the things that hinder flourishing. Do yourself the favor of regularly assessing how you feel in your friendships. As you interact with your friend, ask yourself if you feel comfortable, if you feel respected, and if you’re being your authentic self. Is the relationship mostly enjoyable?</p>
<p><strong><img alt="How to Stem Codependency in Friendships 2" class="alignleft wp-image-36240" height="199" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-to-stem-codependency-in-friendships-3-500x331.jpg" width="300" />Identify red flags</strong> Being able to pick out red flags, or unhealthy behaviors, is a must. Some of these include feelings of guilt, signs of emotional exhaustion after interactions, or being resentful of your friend. If you experience these things, it might be a cue to pause and evaluate the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Have open communication</strong> It’s important that you and your friend have open and honest conversations with each other about the dynamics of your relationship. Such honesty is essential for fostering understanding and cultivating a strong relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Nurture independence</strong> Your personal identity matters and taking steps to cultivate it is ultimately beneficial to you and your relationships. After all, a good friend should want you to be the best version of you that the Lord intended for His glory. Doing things like maintaining interests, hobbies, and relationships outside the friendship are key to nurturing and preserving that sense of independence and personal identity.</p>
<p><strong>Set clear boundaries</strong> Another way to nurture personal identity and lead a way for a healthy relationship is to set clear boundaries. Your boundaries are your limits. They indicate the things that make you who you are, what matters to you, and the ways you flourish. You can have boundaries around money, time, your car, your body, and your social media presence, to name a few. Setting healthy boundaries which protect your needs and respect your friend’s limits are ways to nurture friendship.</p>
<h3>Recovering from Codependent Tendencies</h3>
<p>When you’ve been in a friendship for a while, or any relationship for that matter, resetting the dynamics can feel like an uphill battle. However, it’s possible for a friendship to recover from codependency. For healing from codependent tendencies, it helps to have mutual awareness and an acknowledgment of how unhealthy the dynamic is in the friendship.</p>
<p>Friends who are serious about turning things around can find it helpful to redefine their roles in the relationship. Instead of one being rescued and the other performing the role of rescuer, start shifting toward being equal partners who can support each other without becoming enmeshed or sacrificing your autonomy and individuality.</p>
<p>Encourage each other’s independence and try to balance emotional support with personal responsibility. It can be done by focusing on growth in the relationship rather than blame.</p>
<p>As you make these changes, remember that it takes time to change things. The dynamics in your relationship may have taken years to establish, and things don’t change overnight. Extend grace toward yourself and toward each other as you find your way in the new relationship dynamic.</p>
<p>Codependency may have multiple causes, some of which extend back to the past and one’s formative childhood experiences. Whether you do individual, joint, or group counseling, finding support from a professional counselor is a good next step. Counseling can help you explore the issues, experiences, and patterns that feed your codependency. Your counselor can also help you develop healthier patterns of relating to others and yourself.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Codependency is a dysfunctional way of relating to others marked by a lack of boundaries and an excessive emotional reliance on another person to dictate your value. Instead of looking to God for identity and affirmation, you draw your sense of self-worth from how other people perceive you, and on their approval and need for you. Rooted in fear, signs of codependency are at the heart of people pleasing.</p>
<h3>Healthy Relationships vs. Codependent Relationships</h3>
<p>In a healthy relationship, the needs of both partners are met in a balanced way. They share their lives and support one another while maintaining their separate identities and respecting each other’s boundaries.</p>
<img alt="How to Recognize Signs of Codependency and What to Do About It" class="alignleft wp-image-36231" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-to-recognize-signs-of-codependency-and-what-to-do-about-it-500x333.jpg" width="300" />In a codependent relationship, however, one person’s needs and desires take precedence over the other’s. It presents as an unhealthy, one-sided dynamic in which the codependent person sacrifices himself or herself for the other person. They plan their entire life around pleasing the other person and taking care of their perceived needs, at the expense of their own well-being.</p>
<p>At first, the codependent relationship may feel mutually beneficial, with the giver feeling needed and as though he or she is contributing something positive to the other person’s success and happiness. Later, though, resentment and frustration are likely to creep in when no matter how hard he or she tries, he or she can never succeed in changing or redeeming the other person.</p>
<p><em>You can’t heal what you don’t acknowledge. </em><strong>– Jack Canfield</strong>
<h3>Telltale Signs of Codependency</h3>
<p>You might be codependent if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You look for things outside yourself to boost your sense of self-worth, such as taking care of or rescuing other people.</li>
<li>You enjoy the feeling of being relied upon and needed, and often form one-sided relationships.</li>
<li>You constantly put other people’s needs above your own and feel responsible for meeting them, even when it means neglecting your own well-being to do so.</li>
<li>You feel responsible for what the other person feels and does. It may feel as though you need to save them from themselves by trying to fix their problems and rescue them instead of letting them face the consequences of their bad behavior.</li>
<li>You don’t know who you are outside the needs and expectations of others. You have trouble being assertive and asking for what you require.</li>
<li>You often say yes when you would rather say no. You do things you don’t want to do or that compromise your values just to make the other person happy and keep them from rejecting or abandoning you.</li>
<li>Your self-worth is dependent on what other people think of you, and you have a need for constant reassurance, validation, and approval.</li>
<li>You feel worthless unless you are needed by and making sacrifices for another person.</li>
<li>You try hard to please others, and feel resentful if they don’t respond the way you want or expect them to.</li>
<li>You are afraid of being abandoned and alone, and will do whatever it takes to stay in a relationship, even if it is a bad or abusive one.</li>
<li>You brush off your partner’s tendency to insult or belittle you. You defend him or her, or shift the blame to yourself, if friends or loved ones speak out about his or her abusive behavior toward you.</li>
<li>You are attracted to needy people, and needy people seem to be attracted to you as well.</li>
<li>You focus on other people’s needs and emotions but are out of touch with your own. Your mood tends to be a reflection of the other person’s feelings rather than yours. If they are happy, you are happy too, but if they are not, neither are you.</li>
<li>You tend to obsess about what others think about you. You have a strong need for approval, recognition, and feeling important and essential to feel good about yourself.</li>
<li>You apologize or take the blame for things you didn’t do just to avoid conflict and keep the peace.</li>
<li>You have trouble making decisions because you worry that your choice may conflict with the other person’s needs.</li>
<li>You feel guilty when you take time for yourself to focus on your own needs or do anything outside your relationship that you enjoy.</li>
<li>You are afraid to stand up for yourself and may end other friendships just to maintain the other person’s approval.</li>
<li>You are afraid of being judged or rejected and tend to hide your real thoughts, feelings, and opinions out of fear that they would upset the other person and cause them to leave you.</li>
<li>You constantly try to change, fix, or rescue the other person instead of letting him or her face the consequences of his or her actions.</li>
<li>You have difficulty setting and maintaining boundaries and tend to become so enmeshed with the other person that you have trouble recognizing what your own feelings or needs are.</li>
<li>You feel threatened by disagreements. You tend to take things personally when someone expresses an opinion different from yours, instead of realizing that it is just an opinion and not a reflection of you.</li>
<li>You feel a need to constantly check in with the other person and feel panicky if you haven’t heard from him or her for a while. You start imagining worst-case scenarios.</li>
<li>You neglect important areas of your life to please the other person and routinely cancel plans with others at the last minute to spend time with him or her instead to avoid displeasing him or her.</li>
<li>You have mixed feelings about your relationship but are so focused on the other person that you do not take time to process your own feelings, and may experience a rollercoaster of emotions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How To Bring Balance Back into Your Relationships</h3>
<p><strong><img alt="How to Recognize Signs of Codependency and What to Do About It 1" class="alignright wp-image-36232" height="211" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-to-recognize-signs-of-codependency-and-what-to-do-about-it-2-500x351.jpg" width="300" />Focus on self-awareness</strong> The first step is to become aware of and acknowledge your codependent behavior. If you’re not seeing it, ask someone you trust if they’ve noticed anything unbalanced about the dynamics of your relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Take small steps to create separation</strong> Create some separation between you and the other person by spending time with supportive friends or family members. Try finding a hobby or activity you enjoy engaging in outside of the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Check your motives</strong> Check your motives to see whether you really are trying to be supportive, or whether you are trying to manipulate the other person into doing what you want him or her to do or be who you want him or her to be.</p>
<p><strong>Stop enabling</strong> Practice offering support only if support really is needed. Commit to avoid trying to take control or engage in enabling behaviors such as trying to fix his or her problems, or bail him or her out, that prevent him or her from facing the consequences of his or her actions.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="How to Recognize Signs of Codependency and What to Do About It 2" class="alignleft wp-image-36233" height="300" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-to-recognize-signs-of-codependency-and-what-to-do-about-it-3-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Be true to yourself</strong> Be open and honest about your own needs and desires, and practice asserting yourself and saying no when asked to do something you really don’t want to do, or that goes against your principles. Exhausting your time and energy, codependently trying to please others while having unmet needs of your own, can lead to a root of bitterness when you feel your efforts are unnoticed or unappreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Set healthy boundaries</strong> Boundaries are limits that define where you end and the other person begins, protect what you value, and limit others from encroaching on your personal space. Even Jesus set personal boundaries that included time for rest and prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Look to Jesus for validation</strong> Jesus loves you unconditionally and is the only one who can provide the validation and purposefulness you are looking for. Learn who you are in Him and what your true identity is.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever heard the expression “You’re your own worst enemy”? You’d think that we always have our own best interests at heart, but that’s not always true. When you’re fighting depression, one of the realities you’ll be confronted with is that your mind can be working against you, and you can be your own worst enemy. It’s important to get the right support and have a clear strategy to deal with depression effectively.</p>
<p>When you approach depression as something of a challenge that needs to be managed rather than an enemy that you need to conquer and defeat all at once, you can build effective strategies that promote your resilience and emotional health in the long term.</p>
<h3>Facing the Key Challenges of Depression</h3>
<p>As you address depression, an important part of that is to understand what depression is. Depression is a mood disorder, a medical and psychological condition that affects the way you think, feel, and behave in everyday situations. When you struggle to regulate your own emotions and thoughts, you’ll often feel like you’re not yourself. Having depression isn’t a personal weakness or a character flaw. You need to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>It’s also important that you educate yourself about how things like your brain chemistry, genetics, stressors, and your environment play a role in depression. By tracking your mood and identifying the triggers that are relevant to you, you can be better prepared to deal with what comes.</p>
<img alt="Fighting Depression: Ways to Cope When You’re Feeling Depressed" class="alignleft wp-image-36220" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fighting-depression-ways-to-cope-when-youre-feeling-depressed-500x333.jpg" width="300" />The key challenges that often come with depression include the fact that you’ll typically experience a loss of energy and motivation. Many people who have gone through depression report feeling tired and unmotivated, to the point where even simple tasks like getting dressed, typing out a message, or meeting a friend for coffee feel overwhelming. Things that once were a breeze or routine can feel like a feat.</p>
<p>Your thought patterns are also affected by depression. You may find yourself caught up in negative thought spirals, where you’re berating or criticizing yourself, feeling hopeless and guilty, or even declaring yourself worthless. These kinds of negative thoughts can dominate your mental landscape, making it harder to get out of the funk of depression.</p>
<p>Another related challenge is that of social withdrawal. You may not feel up to company, even though that can help you feel connected. Loved ones can also help you challenge untrue and unhelpful things you may be saying to yourself. When you’re isolated, it worsens the symptoms of depression but being withdrawn and isolated can become your default.</p>
<p>You may also experience other physical, mental, and emotional challenges. These would include struggling to fall and stay asleep, which contributes to fatigue. Others tend to sleep too much, making it hard to get on with other things in life. Changes in appetite can also lead to unplanned weight loss or gain. You may also feel more irritable, which can create relationship issues. Your mind may also feel a bit sluggish, making it hard to remember or focus.</p>
<p>These are just some of the challenges that can be brought about by depression. They affect how you function in the world, your energy levels, and whether you can perform daily tasks well.</p>
<h3>Fighting Depression: Reclaiming Your Joy</h3>
<p>It is possible to fight depression. That fight is gradual and takes time. It’s important to think of it as more of a journey than a quick battle. It can be disheartening and disappointing to wrestle with something longer than you expected. The journey of coping with and overcoming depression entails developing an understanding of what depression is and how it affects you in particular, as well as steps to manage it well.</p>
<p>The journey of dealing with depression won’t look the same for everyone. The steps that you can take include the following:</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Fighting Depression: Ways to Cope When You’re Feeling Depressed 1" class="alignright wp-image-36221" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fighting-depression-ways-to-cope-when-youre-feeling-depressed-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Acknowledge the condition</strong> If you find yourself facing several of the challenges mentioned already, accepting that you may be dealing with depression is a vital first step. When you deny what could be happening to you, that delays the healing process. Facing stigma and other unhelpful ideas about depression is essential. Depression is a common condition that affects people from all walks of life.</p>
<p><strong>Seek professional help</strong> When you consider how depression affects you, it’s important to acknowledge that other conditions may produce similar symptoms. This could include a thyroid condition or chronic stress. Talking with a doctor, psychologist, counselor, or psychiatrist can help you identify what’s going on. You need a proper assessment to determine your specific situation.</p>
<p>When you get professional help, it can identify whether you’re dealing with depression, and it can also help you understand how severe that depression is. Eliminating other possible causes allows you and your doctor to develop an appropriate treatment plan that will help you restore functionality and a sense of normalcy.</p>
<p><strong>Pursue therapy or counseling</strong> Seeing a mental health professional, like a counselor, can help you deal with the various challenges that depression presents. Therapies such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help you to reframe negative and unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors that can trigger or worsen depression.</p>
<p>There may be circumstances where medication is required. With cases of moderate to severe depression, taking medication like antidepressants under medical supervision can be a key part of the treatment plan, in addition to counseling. Medication can help to reduce the symptoms of depression, allowing you to implement other changes to nurture your well-being.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Fighting Depression: Ways to Cope When You’re Feeling Depressed 2" class="alignleft wp-image-36222" height="196" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fighting-depression-ways-to-cope-when-youre-feeling-depressed-3-500x326.jpg" width="300" />Build a support system</strong> When dealing with depression, you’re more likely to shy away than seek connection, but you need other people in your life to support you. Some folks experience feelings of shame or a sense of weakness, and that stops them from reaching out to friends, family, and other loved ones. A support system can ground you and help you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>Make daily self-care a priority</strong> Your well-being can improve steadily through the small, daily things you do for yourself. Whether it’s journaling, taking a daily run or a short walk, getting your full eight hours of sleep, eating an enjoyable meal, or getting a haircut, these small things add up. They help you regain a sense of yourself and to feel good.</p>
<p>Take the time to make small but meaningful adjustments to your daily routine and lifestyle, as these can support good mental health. Exercise, quality sleep, and lowering your intake of alcohol and other substances all make a difference in how your body feels and how you enter and go through each day.</p>
<p><strong>Routine is your friend</strong> Depression can bring a certain kind of brain fog with it. It’s hard to concentrate or to remember things and making major decisions can become quite daunting. One way to deal with this is to defer any major decisions like changing your relationship status, moving, or changing jobs. Having a structured routine with small achievable goals can counteract the malaise of depression.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Fighting Depression: Ways to Cope When You’re Feeling Depressed 3" class="alignright wp-image-36223" height="201" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fighting-depression-ways-to-cope-when-youre-feeling-depressed-4-500x335.jpg" width="300" />Keep abreast of progress and adjust</strong> As you make these small changes in your life, it’s important to take stock periodically. Doing this with someone like your counselor can help you refine your treatment plan and strategies, so you continue to implement changes that make a difference. You can make any necessary adjustments needed to stay on top of things.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling with depression, it can impact your life significantly. It’s important that you reach out to a counselor sooner rather than later to begin making necessary changes in your life. The path to recovery doesn’t look the same for everyone. For many, significant improvement happens with consistent treatment, with tangible changes occurring in weeks and months.</p>
<p>Reach out and talk with a counselor who specializes in depression to begin your journey toward healing. Challenges and setbacks do happen along the way, but as you walk alongside your counselor, you can build your resilience and ability to cope with depression. It’s possible to reclaim your joy and begin to overcome depression.</p>

<title>How to Stop Worrying: Effective Steps to Overcome Worry</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>For some, worrying feels as natural as breathing, and being told to stop worrying feels like an impossible ask. The way to stop worrying is not by simply gritting your teeth and telling yourself to stop. It takes time and effort, but there are effective tools you can use to help you stop worrying and reclaim peace.</p>
<h3>Why do people worry?</h3>
<p>One of the first things to address as you seek to understand and overcome worry is to figure out why people worry. Jesus repeatedly tells His disciples not to worry, dedicating time and space to reassure them of the Father’s care and concern for His people (Matthew 6:25-34). Even among God’s people, worry is a reality. We may not worry about the same things, or to the same extent, but we all have moments when worry consumes us.</p>
<p>Worry can be seen as a natural emotional response one has to certain life situations. Worrying is when your mind and heart go around in circles over a particular issue, trying to make sense of things. Worry is not the same thing as brainstorming or problem-solving. Worry is repetitive, involving dwelling on a situation or possible outcomes, without taking action to change things.</p>
<p>People tend to worry when they experience uncertainty or when they feel concern about the future and possible outcomes of actions. People also worry when they face real or perceived threats to their well-being. Worry engages the mind even when there’s nothing more that can be done. For instance, worrying over a test that’s already been taken, or decisions that are out of our hands.</p>
<p>A key reason why we worry is that we have an innate desire to control the situations we find ourselves in. Worry feels like a way to tame the uncontrollable, to put our fears to rest. Whether to protect ourselves or to prepare for potential challenges ahead, worry can feel like a way to handle a situation that is truly out of our control.</p>
<h3>Is it unspiritual or unchristian to worry?</h3>
<p>A believer may find themselves contending with the question of whether they are being unfaithful when they worry. Is it a sign of a lack of trust in the Lord? Many factors contribute to why people worry, making worry a complex experience to categorize.</p>
<p>People worry as a result of past experiences, for instance. You’re more likely inclined to ruminate if things have gone awry in the past, and you anticipate it could happen again. A person’s personality may predispose them to worrying, and there may also be biological factors that play a role in how much a particular individual worries.</p>
<p>Worrying is a common human experience, but that doesn’t make it a morally neutral feeling either. If our worry is rooted in the desire for control, in our fear, and a way to protect ourselves, it raises the question of where our trust and hopes lie. Many biblical characters we encounter indeed express worry or anxiety, reminding us that we are not alone in the struggle.</p>
<p>What Scripture does in passages such as Philippians 4:6-7 or Matthew 6:25-34 is to encourage believers not to live lives mired in worry and anxiety. The antidote, it seems, is to trust that God cares for you and that He is in sovereign control of your circumstances. You don’t have to worry because God’s got you. Instead of worrying, pray. Instead of looking inward to your own strength, look to the Lord for help.</p>
<p>These and other Scriptures may not necessarily show that you’re being unspiritual or unfaithful when you worry. They aren’t functioning as a condemnation of worry, but as an attempt at lightening the loads we place upon ourselves. Instead of condemning us, these and many other passages in Scripture are inviting us into a place of peace through steadfast faith and reliance on a good God.</p>
<h3>When Worry Becomes Unhelpful</h3>
<p>Have you ever done something thinking it would help you, but it turned out to be bad for you? Sometimes the things we do with the best intentions don’t always work out as hoped. There’s a sense in which a little bit of worry can be beneficial, but a lot isn’t helpful. If thinking about a problem or situation leads to problem-solving and positive action, that’s a good thing.</p>
<img alt="How to Stop Worrying: Effective Steps to Overcome Worry" class="alignleft wp-image-36213" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-to-stop-worrying-effective-steps-to-overcome-worry-500x333.jpg" width="300" />The problem with worry is that it is often unproductive. Worry can leave you paralyzed, thinking the same thoughts over and over again, without actually moving forward. If your mind were a room, worry makes you wear deep holes in the carpet, all the while leaving you without actual solutions. You pace back and forth, but the problem doesn’t get any smaller, and the issue remains.</p>
<p>Worry can become chronic, derailing you by interfering with everyday life. At its worst, worry can give rise to anxiety disorders, which severely hamper your ability to function, make effective decisions, and enjoy life. Worry can even generate a cycle where you worry about your worrying, amplifying stress and making it hard to cope.</p>
<p>If worry has a grip on you, it begins to take a toll on your mental, emotional, and physical health. When you’re worried, it can prevent you from sleeping well. Poor sleep causes all sorts of problems, including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, poor emotional regulation, and irritability. Chronic worry may also result in digestive issues, a weakened immune system, and headaches.</p>
<p>Worry can impact your relationships. If you worry or are an overly anxious person, that can manifest as neediness, being clingy, withdrawal, or even as overprotectiveness. These traits can cause significant strain in a relationship. If you worry a lot, it can hinder open communication in the relationship, as you fear that discussing concerns might cause conflict or damage the relationship.</p>
<h3>How to Stop Worrying – Some Helpful Tips</h3>
<p>Worrying might feel natural to you, or perhaps you only experience it periodically, but with intensity. Some of the ways you can overcome worry and bring it under control would include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Be mindful</strong> Being mindful is about grounding yourself in the present moment. It’s about being more aware of the here and now and learning to reduce any tendencies to dwell on the future or uncertainties. You can train yourself to focus on what your senses are perceiving, to notice your breathing, and how your body is feeling. Focusing on the here and now and celebrating it can be one way to stop worrying.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive restructuring</strong> Sometimes we worry as a well-worn pattern of thinking and being, even when we know it doesn’t benefit us. Instead of accepting worry as a given, it’s possible to challenge negative thought patterns. These patterns should be weighed as you consider evidence for or against your worries. Don’t take the negative thought patterns as givens that can’t be challenged or disrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong> Engaging in prayer and meditating on comforting Scriptures can provide you with solace and a sense of comfort. These practices can also help you discover reasons to relinquish your worries to the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>Make healthy lifestyle choices</strong> To counteract the negative effects of worry, make healthy choices such as regular exercise, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep each night. This can improve your resilience. If you’re in a better frame of mind and have a healthy body, it helps you cope with stress.</p>
<p><strong>Set aside worry time</strong> Worrying can overtake your life. Instead of giving it free rein, allocate a specific time each day to acknowledge your worries, which can serve to prevent them from intruding on daily activities. Present your worries to the Lord and slowly learn the discipline of letting those worries go once you’ve handed them over to Him.</p>
<p><strong>Seek support</strong> Worrying is an all-too-common experience, but it can be managed. You don’t have to do it alone, though. Talk to wise and trusted friends and family about the things you’re worrying about. You can also speak with a professional, like a Christian counselor. They can provide you with perspective and practical strategies to process your fears better and reduce feelings of isolation.</p>
<p>With compassion toward yourself and eyes of faith, you can learn to manage your worrying to improve your well-being. Reach out for support and talk with someone to stop worrying. The counselors on this site can help.</p>

<title>Managing Social Anxiety Disorder Around the Holidays</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been there. The crowded malls. The shoulder-to-shoulder seats in the auditorium for the children’s Christmas concert. The large family gathering. The Fall Festival or Christmas Parade.</p>
<p>But for someone with social anxiety disorder, these occasions create a sense of panic, making it hard to breathe and difficult to think. They may have a panic attack not only at the event, but on the way. Or, even a few days beforehand, as they imagine the scenario.</p>
<p>Social anxiety disorder can cause conflict at home, work, and in relationships. However, with practice, patience, and grace, you can manage the symptoms of social anxiety disorder.</p>
<h3>Tips for Managing Social Anxiety Disorder This Holiday Season</h3>
<p>This holiday season doesn’t have to end up like last year’s. You can take control of social anxiety disorder with a few psychological strategies, lifestyle changes, and planned events. It’s essential to remember, as you journey through healing and alleviating symptoms, that the reason we celebrate the holidays is centered on God’s gift, the birth of Jesus. Followed by the ringing in of a new year with our families, to be the person God created us to be.</p>
<p>Prayer should be at the backbone of learning how to manage any mental condition. Drawing closer to Christ enables you to see the grace and mercy that He offers. When we allow those traits to wash over us, a sense of peace grows. It is through this peace that we can find freedom as we work through the symptoms of social anxiety disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Talk to a counselor</strong></p>
<p>Talking to a counselor can help you discover what is behind your social anxiety and examine the thoughts and beliefs that have become its foundation. Often, we believe intrusive thoughts, even when they are false. Counseling and talk therapy can help challenge these negative beliefs.</p>
<p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a method that mental health practitioners use to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, aiming to change emotions and behaviors. You will learn how to identify and challenge these thoughts and replace them with positive ones. You will learn new coping mechanisms to help you deal with social anxiety disorder symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Look into virtual group sessions</strong></p>
<p>Virtual group sessions may sound scary to someone struggling with social anxiety, but they offer gradual exposure in a safe setting. For example, if you are invited to a virtual support group with others, you can choose to leave your camera off until you are ready to try it for yourself. You can speak up in small answer sessions. Smaller groups may make you feel more confident. If you feel panicked, you can turn off your camera or ask for help.</p>
<p>The others in the group have also struggled with social anxiety. Some may have overcome the symptoms and now work with others. Some participants may offer advice and encouragement. Ask your counselor or check with your local hospital or community center to find out about virtual support groups led by a mental health professional.</p>
<p><strong>Start walking</strong></p>
<img alt="Managing Social Anxiety Disorder Around the Holidays 1" class="alignleft wp-image-57309" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/managing-social-anxiety-disorder-around-the-holidays-2-500x334.jpg" width="300" />Although walking can be a solitary venture, focus mainly on the health benefits initially. Walking at a brisk pace gets the heart pumping, and this action triggers the release of hormones, such as serotonin and dopamine, which can leave you feeling less stressed and happier. Endorphins are also released, further leaving you with a sense of confidence and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Use the benefits of walking to propel you out of your comfort zone. Once you start to feel more confident, try lengthening your walk into areas that are a little more crowded or consider joining a walking group. If you shop in a mall or plaza, walk a few laps around between stores. Continue to challenge yourself physically and mentally by changing the setting or distance.</p>
<p><strong>Pencil in only meaningful events</strong>
<p>The holidays can place undue stress on you with activities, starting in October and lasting until New Year’s Day. If social anxiety is an issue, only pencil in the meaningful events. This might be your child’s Christmas performance at school and the family get-together on Christmas Eve. You do not have to attend every invite at least until you have a better handle on your symptoms and have adopted healthy coping mechanisms to navigate through holiday events.</p>
<p>Politely decline by addressing that you would love to, but you have had to cut back on events this year. You are doing this for your mental health and wellness. Committing to more holiday events than you can handle will only leave you stressed and dreading the event. Choose the events that are important to you and your family. When you feel more confident, you can add more.</p>
<p><strong>Tame your stress with deep breathing</strong></p>
<p>Chronic stress worsens social anxiety. It is a vicious cycle. You dread an upcoming event to the point of physical symptoms and panic attacks. Yet, you may carry an underlying anxiety disorder, and chronic stress triggers those reactions.</p>
<p>You can tame your stress by pausing and practicing deep breathing. When we get anxious, we breathe faster and shallower, preparing our bodies to run from perceived danger. Deep breathing forces us to be still and focus on breathing, filling our lungs to capacity and then slowly exhaling through the mouth. Try inhaling through the nose for the count of four, holding the breath for the count of seven, then releasing through the mouth for the count of eight. Repeat as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Practice communication skills</strong></p>
<p>Social anxiety disorder can make you feel vulnerable, shy, and awkward. You may have trouble speaking to others or making eye contact. Communication skills are learned skills. You can learn to step gradually out of your comfort zone to have conversations and ask questions, all while maintaining eye contact with others.</p>
<p>A counselor can teach you the necessary communication skills, including active listening. You can practice with your counselor, and then go out into the world to apply what you’ve learned. The process is dependent on how your confidence grows. For example, your counselor may suggest that you try holding eye contact while talking to at least three people this week and report back on your progress.</p>
<p><strong>Give yourself plenty of time to recharge</strong></p>
<p>Social events can be especially draining to someone struggling with social anxiety disorder. This holiday season, as you choose events that mean the most to you, plan for breaks in between. For example, if you attend a Christmas concert on a Friday evening, give yourself Saturday to recharge.</p>
<p>You can use this strategy throughout the year as well. Choose a day to grocery shop and run errands only when you can enjoy the following day as downtime. On these peaceful, recharging days, do an activity that you love and provides peace for your soul.</p>
<p><strong>Try gradual exposure</strong></p>
<p>Gradual exposure ensures that you are challenging yourself while still being in control. During the holidays, gradual exposure could involve joining a small caroling group, walking through familiar neighborhoods to sing. It could be shopping at your favorite store at the least busiest time with a short list. Gradual exposure could also involve buying a coffee or hot chocolate and sitting in a relaxed café, listening to others, and taking note of how you feel.</p>
<p>The more you expose yourself to social gatherings, the more at ease you will eventually feel. Some people can tolerate small gatherings fine, but panic in packed auditoriums. As you progress through exposure therapy, you will work up to social events that you feel a little more at ease at while implementing healthy coping mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
<p>Christian counseling combines faith in God with psychology to help shift mindset, heal trauma, and overcome the symptoms of mental conditions. Social anxiety disorder doesn’t have to end your fun. You can make changes in your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors leading up to this holiday season. Contact our center today to get started.</p>

<title>Mental Health for Teens: Challenges and Opportunities to Provide Support</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A person’s mental health affects much of how they function in daily life. The same is true when we’re talking about mental health for teens. There’s a school of thought suggesting that mental health doesn’t matter; that whatever comes your way, you just need a stiff upper lip and to simply push through it or past it. Resilience is a good thing, but it must be part of a healthy approach to one’s well-being, which includes mental health.</p>
<p>Teens may seem quite carefree, with ‘seem’ being the operative word. Teens may not face the same challenges that people in other age groups do, but that doesn’t mean they don’t experience similar challenges, or challenges that are particular to their stage of life. Knowing what good mental health is, and how to nurture it can be helpful to teens and to their parents or caregivers.</p>
<h3>Defining Good Mental Health for Teens</h3>
<p>Mental health is about more than just whether you have a healthy brain or your mind is in good working order. One good way to think of mental health is holistically. It’s about your capacity to handle life’s adversities, how you view yourself, and how adaptable you are to life’s many ups and downs.</p>
<p>A person with good mental health can manage stress effectively. The ability to adapt to changes and challenges is also a sign of good mental health. You can be said to be in good mental health if you’re able to initiate and maintain fulfilling and healthy relationships with others. Making sound decisions that promote your well-being and help you accomplish your goals is also a part of having good mental health.</p>
<p>Other facets of good mental health include the ability to enjoy life and have a positive self-image. How you view yourself, and how you treat and relate to yourself, are all part of mental health. If you don’t value yourself or see your self-worth and dignity as a creature made in God’s image, it affects your mental health. It will impact how you treat yourself and relate to others.</p>
<p>Lastly, good mental health is also about having emotional resilience. That’s the ability to bounce back from hardship and weather the storms of life. Life will always give us lemons. After all, we live in a fallen and broken world. We experience loss, grief, rejection, disappointment, and many other things. The ability to go on despite these realities is called resilience, and it’s also an aspect of good mental health.</p>
<h3>Some Challenges for Teen Mental Health</h3>
<p>Having good mental health doesn’t mean you won’t face problems or that you won’t struggle. Rather, good mental health means that <em>when </em>you face those challenges, you’re able to face them well. You might get knocked down, but you’ll be able to get up again, and again, and again.</p>
<p>There are some significant challenges when it comes to mental health for teens. Teens face the same issues as adults, like dealing with the loss of loved ones or feeling overwhelmed by life’s pressures. They do, however, face issues more specific to their stage of life. As their parent or caregiver, there may be parallels to your own past experiences, which can help you empathize with them.</p>
<p>Some of the unique and main challenges that teens face that can negatively impact their mental well-being include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Social and interpersonal dynamics</strong> Unfortunately, the teen years can be fraught with issues such as bullying, whether in person or online. Teens may experience, acutely and perhaps for the first time, peer pressure and the deep desire to fit in. No one wants to stand out for the wrong reasons, and that feeling is quite pronounced during the teen years.</p>
<p><strong>Family concerns</strong> Teen mental health can also be affected by issues within their family. Examples include family financial difficulties that change their circumstances drastically, their parents getting divorced, or family conflict. Conflict can be a huge source of stress.</p>
<p><strong>Academic pressures</strong> Teens also face enormous amounts of stress from exams, grades, working toward future career prospects, performing well academically, and participating in their extracurricular activities. Many young people also carry a burden for the future, and they want the world to change. This can become overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>Social media and technology</strong> Being connected to the world 24/7 via social and other media can be a huge burden. Not only is cyberbullying and the nastiness spread across the internet a thing to contend with, but there’s also exposure to highly unrealistic and damaging standards of beauty or fitness found online. This can feed deep discontent with one’s body or lifestyle, especially in this stage wrought with change.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Mental Health for Teens: Challenges and Opportunities to Provide Support" class="alignleft wp-image-44210" height="225" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/mental-health-for-teens-challenges-and-opportunities-to-provide-support-500x375.jpg" width="300" />Development of personal identity</strong> As a period of transitions and massive changes, the teen years are a time of trying to understand huge questions such as “Who am I? What do I believe in? What matters most to me?” A teen may struggle with their mental well-being as they wrestle with questions of their racial or cultural identity, and as they try to make sense of their sexuality or questions about their gender identity.</p>
<h3>Might your teen be in poor mental health? Signs to Look Out For</h3>
<p>When you live with a teen, you may get your fair share of surly responses, anger outbursts, changes in their behavior, adjustments to arrangements, and so on. They are growing up, and that means they’re renegotiating their place in the world. Friction can sometimes result from this process, and tempers can flare up. How do you tell the difference between this, and signs of distress in your teen?</p>
<p>Some of the signs that your teen might be struggling and not in good mental health would include these:</p>
<p><strong>Reckless behaviors</strong> If your teen is engaging in risky behaviors such as self-harm (cutting, biting, scratching themselves, and so on), substance abuse (drugs, alcohol, or other substances), or being reckless with their own well-being through speeding or otherwise endangering themselves, that might be a sign of poor mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Mood disruptions</strong> If your teen is experiencing irritability, persistent sadness, or mood swings that last for a long while, that might also point to an issue with their mental health. If they are experiencing excessive anxiety that prevents them from going to school or socializing with others, it’s a cause for concern.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in behavior</strong> If your teen has changes that are sudden, drastic, and seem detrimental to well-being, it’s worth paying attention to. Such changes could include a loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, marked changes in sleeping and eating habits that lead to negative life outcomes, or withdrawal from loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Signs of cognitive decline</strong> If your teen shows signs of their cognitive abilities being impacted negatively, they could point to deeper underlying issues. These could include your teen having difficulty making decisions, their academic performance declining drastically without an identifiable reason, or having difficulty remembering things, concentrating, and completing tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Physical complaints</strong> If your teen has physical symptoms like stomachaches, fatigue, or unexplained headaches, these may suggest deeper concerns. That’s more significant if these ailments don’t respond to the typical treatments for them.</p>
<h3>Providing Support to Nurture Your Teen’s Mental Health</h3>
<p>Parents, caregivers, and other leaders have a positive, significant role to play when it comes to mental health for teens. You can play a role by being aware of how and why poor mental health can occur in an individual’s life. Notice things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A family history of poor mental health and health disorders</li>
<li>Environmental stressors like abuse, neglect, or trauma</li>
<li>A lack of support</li>
<li>Physical health issues, such as being sick or having a chronic health condition</li>
<li>Hormonal fluctuations that come with adolescence</li>
</ul>
<p>Being aware of what’s happening in a teen’s life can make a difference.</p>
<p>Parents and caregivers can provide support to their teen by being vigilant, empathetic, and proactively involved in their teen’s life. Learning about mental health for teens can help. Apart from being educated, paying attention and being observant so that you notice changes in mood or behavior also matters. You can slowly and gently introduce new, healthy habits, like good sleep hygiene, reducing time on devices, eating healthy, or getting physical exercise.</p>
<p>It can take time to break old habits, such as poor listening, overcoming past conflict, and a lack of understanding. Give it time and keep trying. It takes time and consistency to build trust. That consistency is not just showing up consistently, but showing up with love, patience, understanding, and a gentle truthfulness (Ephesians 4:15; 29). This creates a safe space for your teen to be themselves and a willingness to share who they are.</p>
<p>You can also use professional counseling for support. Your teen can go for individual or group counseling to address particular concerns, or your family can go for family therapy if there are dynamics that are contributing to poor mental health. Your teen’s mental health matters. Reach out and talk with a Christian counselor to help your teen work through their challenges and grow into the young person the Lord intends them to be.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s quite possible that the greatest joy a person can have in life is to bring another human being into the world. The joy and beauty that attend the birth of a child are hard to compare to any other experience. However, the process that comes with it can be fraught with challenges, and these can include and even result in anxiety in pregnancy. Thankfully, there are effective and healthy ways to address and cope with anxiety in pregnancy.</p>
<h3>Making Sense of Anxiety in Pregnancy</h3>
<p>The thought of being pregnant can bring many expectations, hopes, joys, fears, and other feelings. It can, at times, be hard to communicate the array of things that can accompany being pregnant. When these feelings or experiences contradict what people expect, that can also be an additional struggle to work through. Being misunderstood can make things feel even harder.</p>
<p>Being pregnant is often depicted as a magical, joyful, and fulfilling time. It is these things, but it carries other complexities and difficulties. It can, for instance, be an uncomfortable time physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and relationally. These discomforts affect one’s well-being. For expectant parents, pregnancy can be a time of heightened anxiety as they not only work through various discomforts but also experience changes in their lives.</p>
<h3>Why would someone feel anxious during pregnancy?</h3>
<p>As joyful as it is to bring a new life into the world, it’s not always a straightforward process. There are many possible causes of anxiety in pregnancy. Being able to identify these causes, understanding how such anxiety affects both mom and baby, and knowing how to cope effectively with such anxieties can make a huge difference in one’s experience.</p>
<h3>Possible Causes of Anxiety in Pregnancy</h3>
<p>Just as in other everyday circumstances, there are several different possible causes of anxiety in pregnancy. Some individuals are generally anxious, but others may be anxious due to specific experiences or fears. During pregnancy, anxiety can stem from several different sources, and they include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Health Concerns</strong> An expectant mother may worry about her baby’s health, particularly if there have been unsettling test results or health checkups during the pregnancy. She may also be anxious about her personal health. That could include whether she’s exercising enough, getting enough rest, or consuming the right nutrients.</p>
<p><strong>Hormonal Changes</strong> It’s no secret that pregnancy triggers significant hormonal shifts in a woman, and that can significantly affect her mood and emotional stability. Managing these emotions can be challenging, resulting in anxious feelings about personal and relational well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Life Changes</strong> Bringing a child into the world requires making significant adjustments. Impending adjustments into parenthood, possible changes in relationships, or new financial pressures that come with raising a child can all fuel and heighten feelings of anxiety. It’s possible to feel unprepared or overwhelmed at the thought of being a parent, and that can cause anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Previous Experiences</strong> Another possible source of anxiety in pregnancy is having a history of miscarriage, complicated pregnancies, or mental health issues. If a previous pregnancy was complex, that could heighten fears of things going wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Fear of labor and Delivery</strong> The labor and delivery process can raise concerns about the pain, process, birth options, and potential complications of childbirth. These fears are common, and they can be dispelled by attending birth classes to learn more. Even with this, they can linger. If a woman has had a difficult childbirth experience before, unresolved trauma can also fuel anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Support</strong> Anxiety in pregnancy may also be the result of a lack of support. Going through pregnancy alone or with minimal support, and if there is likely to be little support provided in raising the child, that could also fuel concerns and anxiety.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Healthy Ways to Cope with Anxiety in Pregnancy" class="alignleft wp-image-36203" height="200" src="https://texaschristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/healthy-ways-to-cope-with-anxiety-in-pregnancy-500x333.jpg" width="300" />An Anxious Disposition</strong> If a person is generally anxious, or they struggle with anxiety to the point where it’s challenging for them to function in daily life, they may be anxious when they become pregnant. Anxiety and anxiety disorders can be the result of genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. This anxiety can then rear its head in pregnancy.</p>
<p>These different possible causes of anxiety can have varying degrees of influence on a particular individual’s experience of anxiety. Knowing where your anxiety is rooted can help in addressing it effectively.</p>
<h3>How Anxiety Impacts the Experience of Pregnancy</h3>
<p>We all worry occasionally about all sorts of things in our lives. Such worry is normal, even when it isn’t altogether helpful to our well-being. When it comes to anxiety, especially anxiety of the persistent and pervasive kind, it can harm both mom and the baby, as well as their support network.</p>
<p>Anxiety is accompanied by several symptoms, such as elevated heart rate, nausea, sweating, going blank, or struggling to concentrate. One can also become irritable as a result of anxiety. Physical symptoms such as headaches, disturbed sleep, fatigue, and nausea are common, and they can make it hard to experience daily life with a good disposition.</p>
<p>Anxiety can also result in emotional strain. Managing anxiety can be hard, and anxiety can also result in other issues, like emotional strain on relationships. Feelings of anxiety can wind up overshadowing the feelings of excitement, peace, or anticipation that can come with pregnancy. The contrast between what you’re feeling and the expectations of what you or others think you ought to be feeling can lead to guilt and isolation from others.</p>
<p>Anxiety in pregnancy can also impact the well-being of the baby. If your anxiety is intense and prolonged, and if it goes untreated, that can increase the risks of your baby having a low birth weight, a preterm birth, and developmental issues. Such concerns can add to one’s stress and feelings of anxiety, in what can become a dangerous downward spiral. This makes it that much more important to address anxiety effectively.</p>
<h3>Healthy Strategies and Ways to Cope</h3>
<p>Anxiety doesn’t have to get the last word in your life. There are many Scriptures that point to the reality that the Lord wants our lives to be dominated by peace, and a quiet trust in Him and His care for us and our needs (Philippians 4:6; Matthew 6:25-34; 1 Peter 5:7). There are also practical strategies you can implement to cope with and reduce your anxiety levels during pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Open communication</strong> with others is one way to cope with anxiety in pregnancy. Talking through your fears and concerns with your partner, family, or friend can be quite therapeutic. A problem shared may not be halved, but talking things through can help you with perspective, and it can help you feel less alone.</p>
<p><strong>Getting educated</strong> about pregnancy and childbirth through trustworthy friends or relatives who are parents, credible resources, or classes can help alleviate the fear of the unknown, relieving stress and anxiety that comes from not knowing what to expect.</p>
<p><strong>A healthy lifestyle</strong> which includes a balanced diet, appropriate regular exercise, adequate sleep each night, being mindful, and learning relaxation techniques, can all help in the reduction and management of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Professional support</strong> is another key component to managing anxiety effectively. A Christian counselor can use techniques such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help you discern unhealthy patterns of thought and behavior that worsen anxiety. You can learn techniques to disrupt unproductive anxious thoughts and replace these with patterns and habits that promote peace and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Medication</strong> can be helpful for some people. In some instances, medication to manage anxiety may be recommended under medical supervision. This is to treat more severe cases of anxiety.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, if you have a pregnant partner who’s struggling with anxiety, there are ways you can support them effectively. These would include being willing to listen to them without judgment and offering reassurance that they aren’t alone. Active participation in appointments, learning about pregnancy, and sharing in the preparation for the baby’s arrival are all ways to provide meaningful support and reduce anxiety about preparedness.</p>
<p>You can also encourage your partner to engage in self-care routines that promote relaxation and better health. Go for walks with them, help them organize things, take on a bit extra to help reduce their task burden, and be present. If you see them feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope, suggest and encourage them to seek professional support. The sooner anxiety is addressed, the better.</p>
<p>If you or someone you care about is pregnant and struggling with anxiety, there is help. Connect with this office or a counselor near you to learn how to find support for a healthy, happy pregnancy.</p>

<title>4 Steps for Coping With Delayed Grief</title>
<link>https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/articles/4-steps-for-coping-with-delayed-grief</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>People often talk about how difficult it is to get through the first few weeks of grief; however, sometimes grief hits much later than we would have expected. The first few weeks after losing someone usually pass in a blur of funeral preparation, paperwork, and administration tasks. Then everyone gets back to their routines and life carries on, and we begin to worry that we haven’t reacted as we should have.</p>
<p>Delayed grief can hit months or even years later, when, unexpectedly, the floodgates open and it feels as if they can’t be shut. While it is hard to navigate any grief, delayed grief is often confusing, frustrating, and scary, even though it is natural and common.</p>
<h3>Emotions On Pause</h3>
<p>Most people have heard of the five stages of grief, where the first stage is shock. While we do grieve in stages, grief is also often unpredictable, messy, and unique to each person. Still, almost everyone experiences shock when a loved one passes, even when you were anticipating it in some way. When death is sudden, gruesome, or violent, it’s common for people to experience an extended state of shock.</p>
<p>Some situations are too grim for us to process, and so our brain shields us from difficult emotions. The state of shock we experience after losing someone is kind of like airbags that get deployed in a car during a collision.</p>
<p>A shock response is our nervous system’s way of keeping us safe in grief. Shock is meant to only last a brief moment before we move on to process all of the difficult emotions of grief. However, sometimes, we get stuck in this safety mode, where it feels like all of our emotions are on pause.</p>
<p>This can be especially true for the oldest sibling or the responsible one in the family. They were always strong and held things together for the sake of their families. After losing a loved one, they try to be the anchor for everyone else, and often succeed. While they busy themselves with the administrative work of grief and make themselves available for all their living loved ones, their emotions are held at bay for days or even years.</p>
<p>For the people who still feel numb to their loved one’s passing, there may come a day when they are sorting through old things and find a memento that their dead loved one held onto. Or perhaps they hear a familiar song on the radio, or catch a scent in the air. There is often something that triggers a wave of memories and emotions. Years after the fateful day of their loved one’s passing, they are overcome with all of the things they hadn’t yet felt. Delayed grief finds them at an unexpected time.</p>
<h3>What Delayed Grief Feels Like</h3>
<p>Grief doesn’t always feel like a wave of emotions. Delayed grief most often appears as physical exhaustion. When a person’s nervous system has been in survival mode for so long, trying to keep them safe from overwhelming emotions, at some point, it simply gets tired.</p>
<p>In delayed grief, things like time management, planning, and chores suddenly become difficult or impossible. They might start spending more time in bed, and their sleep patterns change. They might start dreaming of the lost loved one more regularly and begin thinking of them more often than usual. All of these are signs that the airbags, which were keeping them safe from grief, have deflated, and it is time to confront the thoughts and feelings they avoided.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="4 Steps for Coping With Delayed Grief" class="alignleft wp-image-6934" height="200" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/4-steps-for-coping-with-delayed-grief-310x207.jpg" width="300" /></strong>It is at this point that many people begin developing coping mechanisms. Some of these can be harmful to mental, physical, and emotional health. The problem is that no one can teach how to grieve. Grief never feels normal or natural.</p>
<p>At its most intense, grief is something that no one feels capable of dealing with. People use sedatives in the form of food, alcohol, substances, habits, or actual medicine to cope. These things often help us temporarily, but some can complicate things in the long run.</p>
<h3>Coping with Delayed Grief</h3>
<p>Grief is like being on a journey in a strange land for which you have no map. You must venture forward without knowing where you’re going or how long the journey is going to last. Delayed grief is even more disconcerting because, up until the point it is triggered, you felt like you were on familiar ground. Now, suddenly, you must find your way through exhaustion, emotional dysregulation, and loneliness.</p>
<p>While there can be no roadmap for delayed grief, there are some practical things that help people cope. Some of these things might be more effective for certain personality types than others, but all of them are worth trying. Over time, you will discover what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid unhealthy coping strategies</strong></p>
<p>People who develop unhealthy coping strategies will eventually be affected by their habits. Establishing a healthy diet, regular sleep routine, and getting regular exercise can go a long way to helping regulate emotions. Besides this, it is advisable to consult a doctor to ensure that the right medication is taken for any ailments, and to reduce alcohol intake until grief feels more manageable.</p>
<p><strong>Create a grief journal</strong></p>
<p>Something that helps many people is creating a journal of their grief experience. You don’t have to be a writer or poet for this, and it can be as simple as logging daily moods or making a collection of memories of the loved one. A grief journal can be a helpful way of siphoning off overwhelming thoughts and emotions in delayed grief.</p>
<p><strong>Give yourself time and space to grieve</strong></p>
<p>Some people grow up policing their own emotions or having their emotions policed by others. Some people need to learn how emotions work and to allow themselves to feel them. This is especially true in delayed grief.</p>
<p><strong>Connect with a therapist</strong></p>
<p>When a person is sick, they may delay seeing a doctor or physician until they are at death’s door. The fix might have been quick and simple, and they might have spared themselves a lot of discomfort had they acted sooner. The same is true for people on an emotional level. A therapist or counselor is like a doctor for our souls, and we can all benefit from a bit of extra help, especially in grief.</p>
<h3>There Is Hope</h3>
<p>If you have lost a loved one, and you haven’t grieved for them, though a lot of time has passed, you are not abnormal, and you are not a bad person. Things only change when you reach out for help. If you are concerned that you still have not begun grieving them, now is the time to reach out.</p>
<p>You are not a bad person for not grieving, and you are also not beyond help. Grief does not have a map except for the one that people make for themselves as they navigate through it. May you find comfort and rest on your journey and know that you are not alone.</p>
<p>There are counselors and group therapy sessions for grieving people, regardless of how much time has passed since they lost their loved one. If you would like to find one of these counselors or groups, please consult our online catalog. You may also speak with our reception team, who can help connect you to a counselor or group therapy.</p>

<title>Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>When you finally reach adulthood, there is an expectation that the cattiness and drama of middle school will be safely locked in the past. Unfortunately, just because you reach the age of accountability and start interacting in the world as a full-fledged adult, there is no guarantee that you will be free of pettiness and social issues.</p>
<p>Exclusion, gossip, and cliques don’t vanish with age; they simply take on new forms. Instead of the drama of who sits together in the school cafeteria, the issue becomes who gets excluded in after-work hangouts or who gets favoritism from the boss. Being left out as an adult can sting just as deeply as it did when you were a kid. When it happens in the workplace, a place where you spend so much of your life, it can leave you feeling isolated and undervalued.</p>
<h3>Why You Might Be Excluded</h3>
<p>There could be hundreds of reasons you’re being excluded at work, but it’s probably not the one you think. It’s natural to shift the blame to yourself when you’re excluded. Self-flogging is often the default after failure.</p>
<img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace" class="alignleft wp-image-57297" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-500x333.jpg" width="300" />You might wonder what you’ve done to turn people so against you. You might anguish about why you don’t measure up in the eyes of your boss or coworkers. You might analyze your work ethic, critique your humor, cringe at your own awkwardness, and scrutinize every conversation, looking for hints as to why you’re being excluded.</p>
<p>If this feels familiar, it’s good to prayerfully survey your life. Then you can look for areas to improve. Authenticity and humility are both goals as a Christian, as is growth in Christ. When your self-esteem and self-assessment are tied to the way you’re treated by others, you may not see things clearly. The way other people treat you might influence how you view yourself. And when people in your workplace don’t treat you right, it can negatively distort your sense of self.</p>
<p>During this period of self-analysis, you might conclude that you’re being excluded from the company party or being excluded from after-work gatherings because there is something intrinsically wrong with you. It’s natural to find fault with yourself, especially when you’ve already been beaten down by external factors. But these faults that you have identified might not actually be what is dictating others’ behaviors.</p>
<h3>Jealousy, Greed, or Fear</h3>
<p>Anytime you find yourself criticized or excluded, it’s important to take a step back and ask yourself what those who are excluding you have to gain from it. People are motivated by many things, but if you trace all those various types of motivations back to their roots, you will usually find jealousy, greed, or fear at the center. Exclusion in the workplace has less to do with who you are and a whole lot more to do with the insecurities of others.</p>
<p>Jealousy shows up in subtle ways, like being left out of conversations, not being invited to lunch, or in the silence that settles over the room when you walk through the door. It can show up in bigger ways, too, often confirming your suspicions of being excluded.</p>
<p>Scripture talks about the destruction of jealousy and what envy does to people and relationships. Proverbs says, “A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots to the bones.” (Proverbs 14:30 NIV) Envy may take root in a co-worker’s heart, but the damage can spill over and hurt the culture and connections around them.</p>
<p><img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace 1" class="alignright wp-image-57298" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-2-500x334.jpg" width="300" />James also talks about jealousy and its power to destroy. “For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and every evil practice” (James 3:16, NIV). That “disorder and every evil practice” can manifest in the workplace as gossip, cliques, and a culture of exclusion.</p>
<p>Seeing jealousy as a fault in those who suffer from it can help shift your perspective. Instead of automatically assuming that you’re the problem, recognize that exclusion often flows out of someone else’s insecurity.</p>
<p>If you’ve had success in life, progress in your job, or appear to have it all together, your coworkers might perceive you as a threat, even if you have never intended to compete with anyone. Their insecurity can make them act out, subtly or overtly, by excluding you, gossiping, or refusing to work with you. This behavior says more about them than it does about your worth or abilities.</p>
<p>Greed is also a contributing factor to exclusion. Some people are motivated by money, status, or advancement. If a coworker perceives you as an obstacle to a promotion, a threat to their reputation, or someone blocking a financial gain, they might exclude you to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Scripture even warns us that greed can influence behavior. “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs,” (1 Timothy 6:10, NIV).</p>
<p>Fear is also a contributing factor in workplace exclusion. Coworkers might fear you, not as a villain, but because you represent something different. Their behavior toward you might not have anything to do with envy or personal advancement, but simply be a fear of change and the unknown.</p>
<p>A coworker might resist including you in projects, decision-making processes, or social activities because you are unfamiliar. People often stick with what feels comfortable.</p>
<p><img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57299" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />There are times you might be part of the problem that leads to being excluded. Be sure to ask God for wisdom and remember there is usually a lot more to it than what you think. Striving to do your best and practicing prayerful reflection about your own attitude and work ethic is important.</p>
<p>When you do this, however, don’t default to assuming that every problem at work is because of some fault in you. It is good, healthy even, to examine your own actions and to grow in your personal relationship with Christ, but exclusion is complex and often rooted in external factors.</p>
<h3>Dealing with Exclusion in the Workplace</h3>
<p>So how can you handle being left out at your place of employment?</p>
<p>First and foremost, maintain your integrity. Your first priority is to do your work as unto the Lord, not your coworker, boss, or company. Keep doing your job well and treating others with respect, even when they don’t do the same. It might be tempting to mirror negative behavior, but your relationship with God should dictate your behavior, allowing you to rise above emotional immaturity.</p>
<p><img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace 3" class="alignright wp-image-57300" height="225" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-4-500x375.jpg" width="300" />You also must learn how to set and maintain healthy boundaries (yes, even if you’re not the boss). Part of that process includes understanding your legal rights and protecting yourself from those who don’t respect them. Know when to engage and when to step out of potentially toxic situations. Find the balance between rightfully defending yourself and perpetuating workplace toxicity.</p>
<p>You can also seek support from a licensed therapist. A professional mental health specialist can help you process the hurtful feelings of exclusion, learn to set those boundaries, and gain some perspective on difficult workplace situations.</p>
<h3>You’re not defined by them</h3>
<p>Thankfully, you’re not defined by your coworkers or boss; you’re defined by God. Your Creator loves you and won’t ever exclude you. In fact, He was so passionate about including you in His family that He sent His own Son to die on a cross so you wouldn’t be excluded. And that type of inclusion supersedes anything that happens on Earth.</p>

<title>Challenging Ten of the Most Common Cognitive Distortions</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>We all go through traumas that shape the way we see the world. For example, we might have a series of negative experiences while traveling abroad, which leads us to conclude that the particular country and culture we visited was awful and inhospitable.</p>
<p>These trauma-informed biases become a lens through which we understand and evaluate the world. However, these lenses are often so warped, cracked, and badly scratched that we don’t see an accurate picture of the world. This is what we call cognitive distortions.</p>
<p>We all have cognitive distortions without even realizing it. These false assumptions and irrational thought patterns often amount to little more than misinformation and prejudice. We can challenge these things and change our minds when presented with other perspectives. However, sometimes these cognitive distortions influence our behavior to toxic degrees.</p>
<p>Unless we identify them and challenge them, they can keep us stuck in certain behaviors, they can poison our relationships, and they can erode our self-esteem.</p>
<p>Jesus once said that before we try to remove the speck of dust from someone else’s eye, we should first remove the log from our own. Challenging our own cognitive distortions means removing those cracked lenses that have been partially blinding us, and, for the first time, seeing a different, more accurate perspective. That is when we realize that the log in our own eye had been obscuring our vision for most of our lives.</p>
<h3>The Ten Most Common Cognitive Distortions</h3>
<p>When we have a warped idea about reality and constantly come to false conclusions about events, we will end up getting stuck. The more cognitive distortions we have, the more we will struggle to grow, heal, and advance in life. We don’t have to feel ashamed for being so affected by these cognitive distortions, but it is essential to confront them.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization</strong></p>
<p>Personalization is when you take the blame for everything that goes wrong. For example, your partner might be in a bad mood, and you automatically assume it is in relation to something you did. You might see a group of people laughing, and you assume they are mocking you. Centering yourself in every event is one of the most common and damaging cognitive distortions.</p>
<p>You challenge this distortion with a perspective shift. Refocus on the reality that not everything revolves around you. You will cause many things to happen in life, but you are not central to as central as you imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Overgeneralization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“The French are rude because that one guy cut me off when I was in Paris.”</li>
<li>“I failed the test; I guess academia must not be for me.”</li>
<li>“He didn’t reply to my text. Everyone is ignoring me!”</li>
</ul>
<p>Broad conclusions like these are distortions of reality because each one is based on a single event or a selective piece of evidence.</p>
<p>The way to challenge these biases is to find exceptions to these statements. Life is so much more nuanced. One experience is not enough evidence to make sweeping conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/challenging-ten-of-the-most-common-cognitive-distortions.jpg"><img alt="cognitive distortions" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-86291" height="169" src="http://localshrink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/roma-kaiuk-r-Q_VIl6uC8-unsplash-300x169.jpg" width="300" /></a>If you were the type of person who was disappointed by the single B amid a sea of A’s on your exam results, you were probably filtering. This is where you ignore all the positives and focus on the negative outcomes. Your perfect day is ruined by one interaction, and it is the single criticism that tanks your mood after giving your work presentation.</p>
<p>You challenge this cognitive distortion by practicing gratitude. Find the positives and celebrate them. Write them down, frame them, or keep a journal of them to remind you.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Reading</strong></p>
<p>This cognitive distortion is common, and it is more damaging to your self-esteem than all the rest. It is where you assume what others are thinking based on no actual evidence. You assume someone is mad at you for not saying hi, that they are bored with your company because they are silent, or that they haven’t forgiven you because you didn’t get an invite to a recent party.</p>
<p>The only way to challenge this is with direct and open communication. Be bold and ask direct questions. Clarify doubt and questioning, querying, and checking in with people.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>This distortion comes from allowing your feelings to dictate your reality. You know that you have done something wrong because you feel guilty. You believe you are unlovable because you feel lonely. You know that the job isn’t the right one for you because it has caused you to struggle and feel overwhelmed. None of these are facts; they are feelings that will change.</p>
<p>This distortion is challenged by finding provable facts. Be diligent in looking for proof for your conclusions, beyond the way you feel. If it can be proven, it is true, and if not, it is only a feeling. Emotions obviously affect your mindset, but they should never dictate your reality.</p>
<p><strong>Catastrophizing</strong></p>
<p>If you always expect the worst-case scenario will happen, you are likely guilty of catastrophizing. You feel like you have ruined things by making one mistake, that something terrible must’ve happened because a friend is late, or that you have contracted a virus because you have a runny nose. This kind of thinking not only keeps you in a state of panic all the time, but it puts others on edge, too.</p>
<p>You need to learn to check reality. Just because something is possible does not mean it is likely. Make a point of noticing how often things go right, especially when you expected something other than a positive outcome.</p>
<p><strong>All or Nothing Extreme Thinking</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t see nuances, gray areas, or the middle ground, your view of reality is distorted. Life is messy and unpredictable, made of wonderful, neutral, and awful things. People are not your enemy for disagreeing with you. Even excellent people have flaws, and it wasn’t a total failure just because something went wrong. Your extreme thinking will alienate your loved ones unless you allow it to be challenged.</p>
<p><strong>Fortune Telling</strong></p>
<p>Accurately foretelling the future would be wonderful, but we can’t. You may sound confident making predictions with this cognitive distortion, such as you will never find love, culture will erode morals, or the year will end on a bad note, but there’s no way you can know that. We can only live one day at a time and do what we can in each present moment. That is your challenge.</p>
<p><strong>“Should” Statements</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, a strict moral code is a distortion in our thinking that aggravates mental health issues. If we are so rigid in holding ourselves and others to this code, we will end up anxious, angry, and frustrated because life is imperfect. Our challenge is that we don’t always have to be successful, or strong, or even happy. Life is a mix of good and bad and in between.</p>
<p><strong>Magnification and Minimization</strong></p>
<p>We often exaggerate the importance of things beginning in our teens. We may focus on our favorite singers or sports stars, while also underestimating the value of other things, like spending time with our siblings. When this mode of thinking carries over into adulthood, it’s often a cognitive distortion. For example, we might downplay a compliment from someone we love, while fixating on a simple mistake we made at work.</p>
<p>As with so many of the other cognitive distortions, we need to challenge this by adopting proportional thinking. We must learn to keep things in perspective. There are real challenges, but they are balanced with genuine breakthroughs. It is only when we can identify both and distinguish them from each other that we begin seeing the world through a clear lens.</p>
<h3>Discover a new way of thinking</h3>
<p>It’s hard to challenge cognitive distortions alone because most of the time, we can’t see how they’re affecting us. Try speaking with a counselor about any cognitive distortions you’re concerned about. You may find a counselor in this online catalog, or our reception team can help you find someone appropriate. Connect with someone today to learn how to find freedom from cognitive distortions.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-4 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-3 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-4"><p>Let’s do a quick mental exercise. Briefly recall the last time that you were in a mildly stressful situation. Maybe you were rushing out the door to your car because you were late for an appointment. Or perhaps you were anticipating having an important conversation with your boss, a friend, or a family member.</p>
<p>Now, once you’ve got that mildly stressful situation in your mind, bring your attention to what’s happening in your body at that moment. What is your breathing pattern? What actions does your body want to take? What sensations do you experience in your body, and where do you feel them? Finally, what emotions come to the surface? All of these are signals that come from a deeper place in you: your nervous system.</p>
<h3>The Nervous System</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25966" height="300" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jonathan-leppan-XhDsInQJ9Mc-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />The human nervous system is a complex and intricate web of nerve cells that send and receive electrical and chemical signals all over our bodies. From our brain stems, through our torso, into our arms, down into our stomachs, and into our legs, it covers a lot of ground, and it is an essential part of us that God has made.</p>
<p>The questions above aim to bring awareness to what our nervous system is telling us about what we are experiencing, even when we may be unaware of it. They slow us down by training our awareness and attention to rest on a specific part of our experience: breathing, action, sensation, and emotion.</p>
<p>Living in the modern world causes a significant amount of stress or anxiety for many people. Between juggling work responsibilities, maintaining friendships, raising children, and making sure basic needs are met, our lives can become overwhelming and fast-paced. While God has graciously given us the ability to adapt to our circumstances and environments, many still find themselves feeling anxious, stressed, depressed, or stuck.</p>
<h3>What Your Nervous System Tells You</h3>
<p>But what if there was a way to understand these symptoms that we experience? What if there were a way to become more aware of the language our nervous system is speaking?</p>
<p>In their book, <em>The Secret Language of the Body, </em>authors Jennifer Mann and Karden Rabin beautifully unpack the science behind the art of attuning to your nervous system. Through their experiences as therapists working with clients and presenting the science of the nervous system, they propose the need to make a shift from our heads to our bodies as the focal point for interpreting the world.</p>
<p>In short, “learning the secret language of the body begins with learning to listen, without judgment, to the unhelpful and habitual thoughts and narratives that are going on in your mind and peer beneath them to the experience of your body.”</p>
<h3>Listening to Your Nervous System</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-25967 alignright" height="300" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/emma-valerio-IqAPbfeqVBA-unsplash-scaled-1-219x300.jpg" width="219" />The first step in learning to speak the language of the body is learning to listen. “Listening is much more than just hearing the messages from your nervous system; the skill of listening for awareness is a deeply regulating practice in and of itself…You already know this from your everyday life. We all long for connection and to be understood. In fact, it’s hardwired into our nervous systems as mammals to seek safety and regulation from our fellow humans. This is called co-regulation.”</p>
<p>By learning to listen to what our nervous systems are telling us, we can tap into the healing power that comes from listening to ourselves.</p>
<p>The beauty of learning to listen to our bodies is that we are partnering with God, through the Holy Spirit, to tend to the temple of the Holy Spirit, which is our physical body. By growing in awareness of the various ways our nervous system becomes dysregulated, we can attune more effectively to how God wants to bring healing.</p>
<p>In Paul’s second letter to the church in Corinth, he writes, “Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light and momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the unseen things.” What if, by learning to tune into our nervous system and the signals it’s giving us, we actively participate in the renewal of our inner selves?</p>
<p>In the process of learning to listen, we are invited into a posture of non-judgmental awareness of our experience. James 2:13 says, “For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.” In Romans 12:1-2, Paul appeals to the church in Rome <em>by the mercies of God</em> to present their bodies to God as a living sacrifice.</p>
<p>By adopting a posture of non-judgmental awareness, we enter into an embodied experience of agreement with the mercy of God toward us. It is in this place of mercy that we can more fully understand what lies underneath the symptoms of our anxiety, depression, or feelings of being stuck. Symptoms always point to a root cause, and the same is true of our somatic experiences.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25968" height="300" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nir-himi-PHi8GsM8J2c-unsplash-scaled-1-169x300.jpg" width="169" />Authors Mann and Rabin go on to say, “…listening is about being present and paying attention to <em>what</em> is happening, not <em>why</em> it’s happening… Asking ‘what’ activates curiosity. When you are curious, you are primed to be in a regulating state for your nervous system. For most of us, the cognitive act of engaging with <em>why</em> is blended with judgement and limiting beliefs that are already ingrained in our brain. As you might imagine, judgement is <em>not</em> a safe regulating state for our nervous system.”</p>
<p>What the authors are getting at here is that learning to listen and developing curiosity are intricately linked to one another. To slightly reframe the quote above, we cannot be genuinely curious or willing to learn about something or someone if we are unable or unwilling to listen.</p>
<p>Listening requires us to intentionally focus our attention and will toward the subject that we want to learn or understand. This requires effort, as does learning to adopt the posture of mercy toward oneself.</p>
<p>“You already know this from your everyday life. We all long for connection and to be understood.” Equally so, we know how good and comforting it feels to have someone show genuine interest and curiosity in us. We know how good it feels to be joined or to have someone be with us in that way.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we know how painful it feels to receive judgment from another person. It dysregulates us because it is a separation from the connection that we were made for with one another, with God, and with ourselves.</p>
<h3>The Path Forward?</h3>
<p>Let’s take a moment to reflect on what has been said. Our bodies hold a complex and intricately designed pathway of nerve cells that controls and coordinates bodily functions via electrical and chemical signals. This is our nervous system. Our nervous system is a pathway of connection throughout our entire body, involving our brains and all other major organs, flowing to our extremities. This system reflects the beauty and glory of God’s creation.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-25969" height="300" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anthony-tyrrell-Bl-LiSJOnlY-unsplash-scaled-1-203x300.jpg" width="203" />Our nervous systems send us signals, and at the same time, we are often unable to interpret these signals correctly. Due to the pace of modern life, we can struggle with symptoms like anxiety, depression, or feeling stuck, but are unsure of how to appropriately address them. One way that we can get underneath the surface of our symptoms and the narratives that our minds are telling us about them is to practice attuning to our nervous systems.</p>
<p>We practice attunement through pausing to intentionally focus our attention and will on four things: our breath, the actions our body wants to do, what sensations we feel in our bodies, and what emotions we are feeling in each moment. By taking time to intentionally listen to these cues, we begin to tap into the language of our nervous system.</p>
<p>When we tap into the language of our nervous systems through taking a posture of listening and non-judgmental awareness, we take an embodied posture of agreement to the mercy of God toward us. We can begin to tend to the house of the Holy Spirit inside of us, our physical bodies, which is the temple of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>As we do this, we can begin to grow in curiosity and awareness by asking ourselves <em>what</em> we are experiencing, instead of <em>why</em> we are experiencing it. Curiosity is a much safer place for our nervous system than judgment. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-3 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-2 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-3"><p>One day, my then-thirteen-year-old daughter and I were playing around. She did something, and I jokingly said, “Shame on you!!” But something in my spirit quickened, and I said, “No! No shame on you! No shame in any of us once we have accepted Christ! Our shame is under the blood!”</p>
<p>Many people, even many Christians, deal with guilt and shame. What’s the difference between guilt and shame? I like the way Sheila Walsh explains it in her book <em>5 Minutes with Jesus: Making Today Matter</em>, “Guilt tells us that we’ve done something wrong; shame tells us that we <em>are</em> something wrong” (p. 32). But she also tells us that the antidote to shame is God’s love.</p>
<p>I love the song by Miranda Lambert (Country artist), “The House that Built Me.” She talks about going back to her childhood home to get some brokenness healed. It’s a gorgeous song. But it doesn’t fully resonate with me. For me, it was the opposite when I visited my hometown. I had bad memories, and condemnation would come in. The enemy would remind me of all the sin I had in my life before I came to Jesus.</p>
<p>One time after getting back from a trip to my hometown, I felt so much condemnation and regret, and I couldn’t shake it. Shortly after arriving home, our pastor at the time preached a message around Romans 8:1, “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” I needed that message at that exact moment. I’ve never forgotten it.</p>
<p>I needed that reminder. I needed that freedom, that release from the old chains being removed. Once I was reminded, I began to hold those negative thoughts captive and remind the enemy that my past was in the past. I have been redeemed. I don’t let the enemy hold my past over my head anymore.</p>
<p>There is a difference between conviction (correction) and condemnation. God whispers gentle reminders to us. It isn’t harsh. It’s a gentle and loving discipline from a good Father. The enemy, on the other hand, makes us feel awful and worthless when he comes at us with condemnation. He will come to us when we are most vulnerable. He’ll even tell us lies about ourselves that we start to believe.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:10 says Satan accuses the brethren day and night. The Bible also tells us, “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.”</p>
<p>What does he come to steal, kill, and destroy?</p>
<p>Steal: He robs people of their peace, joy, and security. He sows doubt and steals faith.</p>
<p>Kill: To extinguish spiritual life: This refers to a spiritual death, leading individuals away from salvation and an abundant life with God. To destroy self-worth and faith: The devil’s actions can kill one’s self-worth or faith in God.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21570" height="200" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty-images-MzSpTw0DRMQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Destroy: To cause chaos and despair: His goal is to bring about total devastation, division, chaos, corruption, and despair in creation and human relationships. To make people give up: By creating terrible situations, the devil tries to weaken a person’s will and make them feel hopeless that their life is over.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jesus wants us to have spiritual peace, joy, meaning, and purpose, which are what the devil seeks to destroy.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I watched The Lion King. I felt like it was an allegory of God, Jesus or us and the devil. Scar (Satan) tempts Simba (us) to go somewhere he isn’t supposed to go. Then, once he goes and there are consequences, he holds the blame over Simba’s head. He makes him feel guilty and unworthy. Even blaming him for something he didn’t even do. If you feel that same kind of guilt, that’s not from God.</p>
<p>The Bible says in Isaiah 43:25:</p>
<p>NLT &#8211; “I – yes, I alone – will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.”</p>
<p>NKJV- “I will not remember your sins!”</p>
<p>If He tells us He won’t remember them, why should we? If we sin and repent, it’s under the blood.</p>
<p>We need to hold negative thoughts captive (as I mentioned before) and remind the devil that Jesus paid it all “…having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross” (Colossians 2:14).</p>
<p>The Bible, good devotionals, Christian music, and reminding myself who I am in Christ help me remember not to allow guilt and shame to try to creep in. There are so many good songs that remind us that God doesn’t want us to be stuck in a pit of shame.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs is “Made for More” by Jenn Johnson, Bethel Music, and Josh Baldwin. These lyrics get me every time:</p>
<p><em>Cause I wasn’t made to be tending a grave</em><br /><em>I was called by name</em><br /><em>Born and raised back to life again</em><br /><em>I was made for more</em><br /><em>So why would I make a bed in my shame</em><br /><em>When a fountain of grace is running my way</em><br /><em>I know I am Yours</em><br /><em>And I was made for more.</em></p>
<p>(“Made for More,” by Josh Baldwin, featuring Jenn Johnson, on Josh Baldwin, <em>Made for More</em>,  Bethel Music, 2024)</p>
<p>The enemy used to try to help me make “a bed of shame” before I knew better.</p>
<p>There are two Zach Williams songs that also have helped me. On his “Rescue Story” album there is a song called “Slave to Nothing” which says:</p>
<p><em>You can tell me what I did</em><br /><em>You  can show me who I was before</em><br /><em>Where I fell short</em><br /><em>Hang it over my head</em><br /><em>But I’m not the same anymore</em><br /><em>One thing’s for sure</em><br /><em>The shackles have fallen</em><br /><em>So, I’m showing shame to the door</em><br /><em>Make no mistake.</em><br /><em>I’m a slave to nothing.</em></p>
<p>(“Slave to Nothing,” by Zach Williams, Track 5 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<p>I also love this one by Zach Williams: “Under My Feet”</p>
<p><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br /><em>Those chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground</em><br /><em>You can’t keep digging up my past</em><br /><em>You may have had a laugh or two, but you don’t get the last</em><br /><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br /><em>[Chorus]</em><br /><em>Maybe I was blind but now I see</em><br /><em>Maybe I was bound but now I’m free</em><br /><em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br /><em>You’re under my feet</em><br /><em>Maybe you’re a lie that I don’t need</em><br /><em>Maybe you should listen when I speak</em><br /><em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br /><em>You’re under my feet</em><br /><em>If you want scars, I’ll show you scars</em><br /><em>All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark</em><br /><em>If I were you, I’d be afraid</em><br /><em>Cause everything you meant for guilt the cross has met with grace.</em></p>
<p>(“Under My Feet,” by Zach Williams, Track 6 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved son. For in the Son all our sins are canceled, and we have the release of redemption through his very blood.</em> – <strong>Colossians 1:13-14, TPT</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NLT reads, “who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.”</p>
<p>Walsh puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>Shame tells us we are worthless. Christ says, “I have made you worthy.” </em><br /><em>Shame tells us we don’t belong. Christ says, “You are mine.” </em><br /><em>Shame tells us we are dirty. Chris says, “I will wash you as white as snow.” </em>(p. 33).</p>
<p>If you struggle with guilt and shame, Christian counseling can help you deal with shame by providing a safe, non-judgmental space to get to the root causes from a faith-based perspective.</p>
<p>A counselor will use Bible-based principles, prayer, Scripture, and therapeutic approaches to help you reframe your self-image, find forgiveness, and develop a stronger relationship with God and others. The goal is to move past toxic shame by connecting with God’s grace and remember your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>So, back to “The Lion King.” When Nala finds the now adult Simba, she tells him he needs to come back to help take their home back from Scar. In the animated version, this conversation ensues between Simba and Rafiki:</p>
<p><strong>Simba:</strong> “I know what I have to do. But going back means I’ll have to face my past. I’ve been running from it for so long.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “It doesn’t matter. It’s in the past.”<br /><strong>Simba:</strong> “Yeah, but it still hurts.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it, or&#8230; learn from it.”</p>
<p>In the newer live/CGI action version this was the conversation that got me:</p>
<p><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Who are you?”<br /><strong>Simba:</strong> “I’m nobody.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Everybody is somebody. So, I ask again, who are you?”<br />Simba hears Mufasa’s voice: “Simba, you must remember who you are: the one true king.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “And so, I asked&#8230;Who are you?”<br /><strong>Simba:</strong> “I am Simba, son of Mufasa.”</p>
<p>We must remember who and Whose we are.</p>
<p>As Rafiki said, “He lives in you.”</p>

She did something, and I jokingly said, “Shame on you!!” But something in my spirit quickened, and I said, “No! No shame on you! No shame in any of us once we have accepted Christ! Our shame is under the blood!”</p>
<p>Many people, even many Christians, deal with guilt and shame. What’s the difference between guilt and shame? I like the way Sheila Walsh explains it in her book <em>5 Minutes with Jesus: Making Today Matter</em>, “Guilt tells us that we’ve done something wrong; shame tells us that we <em>are</em> something wrong” (p. 32). But she also tells us that the antidote to shame is God’s love.</p>
<p>I love the song by Miranda Lambert (Country artist), “The House that Built Me.” She talks about going back to her childhood home to get some brokenness healed. It’s a gorgeous song. But it doesn’t fully resonate with me. For me, it was the opposite when I visited my hometown. I had bad memories, and condemnation would come in. The enemy would remind me of all the sin I had in my life before I came to Jesus.</p>
<p>One time after getting back from a trip to my hometown, I felt so much condemnation and regret, and I couldn’t shake it. Shortly after arriving home, our pastor at the time preached a message around Romans 8:1, “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” I needed that message at that exact moment. I’ve never forgotten it.</p>
<p>I needed that reminder. I needed that freedom, that release from the old chains being removed. Once I was reminded, I began to hold those negative thoughts captive and remind the enemy that my past was in the past. I have been redeemed. I don’t let the enemy hold my past over my head anymore.</p>
<p>There is a difference between conviction (correction) and condemnation. God whispers gentle reminders to us. It isn’t harsh. It’s a gentle and loving discipline from a good Father. The enemy, on the other hand, makes us feel awful and worthless when he comes at us with condemnation. He will come to us when we are most vulnerable. He’ll even tell us lies about ourselves that we start to believe.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:10 says Satan accuses the brethren day and night. The Bible also tells us, “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.”</p>
<p>What does he come to steal, kill, and destroy?</p>
<p>Steal: He robs people of their peace, joy, and security. He sows doubt and steals faith.</p>
<p>Kill: To extinguish spiritual life: This refers to a spiritual death, leading individuals away from salvation and an abundant life with God. To destroy self-worth and faith: The devil’s actions can kill one’s self-worth or faith in God.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25961" height="200" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty-images-MzSpTw0DRMQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Destroy: To cause chaos and despair: His goal is to bring about total devastation, division, chaos, corruption, and despair in creation and human relationships. To make people give up: By creating terrible situations, the devil tries to weaken a person’s will and make them feel hopeless that their life is over.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jesus wants us to have spiritual peace, joy, meaning, and purpose, which are what the devil seeks to destroy.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I watched The Lion King. I felt like it was an allegory of God, Jesus or us and the devil. Scar (Satan) tempts Simba (us) to go somewhere he isn’t supposed to go. Then, once he goes and there are consequences, he holds the blame over Simba’s head. He makes him feel guilty and unworthy. Even blaming him for something he didn’t even do. If you feel that same kind of guilt, that’s not from God.</p>
<p>The Bible says in Isaiah 43:25:</p>
<p>NLT &#8211; “I – yes, I alone – will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.”</p>
<p>NKJV- “I will not remember your sins!”</p>
<p>If He tells us He won’t remember them, why should we? If we sin and repent, it’s under the blood.</p>
<p>We need to hold negative thoughts captive (as I mentioned before) and remind the devil that Jesus paid it all “…having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross” (Colossians 2:14).</p>
<p>The Bible, good devotionals, Christian music, and reminding myself who I am in Christ help me remember not to allow guilt and shame to try to creep in. There are so many good songs that remind us that God doesn’t want us to be stuck in a pit of shame.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs is “Made for More” by Jenn Johnson, Bethel Music, and Josh Baldwin. These lyrics get me every time:</p>
<p><em>Cause I wasn’t made to be tending a grave</em><br /><em>I was called by name</em><br /><em>Born and raised back to life again</em><br /><em>I was made for more</em><br /><em>So why would I make a bed in my shame</em><br /><em>When a fountain of grace is running my way</em><br /><em>I know I am Yours</em><br /><em>And I was made for more.</em></p>
<p>(“Made for More,” by Josh Baldwin, featuring Jenn Johnson, on Josh Baldwin, <em>Made for More</em>,  Bethel Music, 2024)</p>
<p>The enemy used to try to help me make “a bed of shame” before I knew better.</p>
<p>There are two Zach Williams songs that also have helped me. On his “Rescue Story” album there is a song called “Slave to Nothing” which says:</p>
<p><em>You can tell me what I did</em><br /><em>You  can show me who I was before</em><br /><em>Where I fell short</em><br /><em>Hang it over my head</em><br /><em>But I’m not the same anymore</em><br /><em>One thing’s for sure</em><br /><em>The shackles have fallen</em><br /><em>So, I’m showing shame to the door</em><br /><em>Make no mistake.</em><br /><em>I’m a slave to nothing.</em></p>
<p>(“Slave to Nothing,” by Zach Williams, Track 5 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<p>I also love this one by Zach Williams: “Under My Feet”</p>
<p><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br /><em>Those chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground</em><br /><em>You can’t keep digging up my past</em><br /><em>You may have had a laugh or two, but you don’t get the last</em><br /><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br /><em>[Chorus]</em><br /><em>Maybe I was blind but now I see</em><br /><em>Maybe I was bound but now I’m free</em><br /><em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br /><em>You’re under my feet</em><br /><em>Maybe you’re a lie that I don’t need</em><br /><em>Maybe you should listen when I speak</em><br /><em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br /><em>You’re under my feet</em><br /><em>If you want scars, I’ll show you scars</em><br /><em>All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark</em><br /><em>If I were you, I’d be afraid</em><br /><em>Cause everything you meant for guilt the cross has met with grace.</em></p>
<p>(“Under My Feet,” by Zach Williams, Track 6 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved son. For in the Son all our sins are canceled, and we have the release of redemption through his very blood.</em> – <strong>Colossians 1:13-14, TPT</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NLT reads, “who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.”</p>
<p>Walsh puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>Shame tells us we are worthless. Christ says, “I have made you worthy.” </em><br /><em>Shame tells us we don’t belong. Christ says, “You are mine.” </em><br /><em>Shame tells us we are dirty. Chris says, “I will wash you as white as snow.” </em>(p. 33).</p>
<p>If you struggle with guilt and shame, Christian counseling can help you deal with shame by providing a safe, non-judgmental space to get to the root causes from a faith-based perspective.</p>
<p>A counselor will use Bible-based principles, prayer, Scripture, and therapeutic approaches to help you reframe your self-image, find forgiveness, and develop a stronger relationship with God and others. The goal is to move past toxic shame by connecting with God’s grace and remember your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>So, back to “The Lion King.” When Nala finds the now adult Simba, she tells him he needs to come back to help take their home back from Scar. In the animated version, this conversation ensues between Simba and Rafiki:</p>
<p><strong>Simba:</strong> “I know what I have to do. But going back means I’ll have to face my past. I’ve been running from it for so long.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “It doesn’t matter. It’s in the past.”<br /><strong>Simba:</strong> “Yeah, but it still hurts.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it, or&#8230; learn from it.”</p>
<p>In the newer live/CGI action version this was the conversation that got me:</p>
<p><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Who are you?”<br /><strong>Simba:</strong> “I’m nobody.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Everybody is somebody. So, I ask again, who are you?”<br />Simba hears Mufasa’s voice: “Simba, you must remember who you are: the one true king.”<br /><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “And so, I asked&#8230;Who are you?”<br /><strong>Simba:</strong> “I am Simba, son of Mufasa.”</p>
<p>We must remember who and Whose we are.</p>
<p>As Rafiki said, “He lives in you.”</p>

<em>You may have had a laugh or two, but you don’t get the last</em><br />
<em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>[Chorus]</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was blind but now I see</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was bound but now I’m free</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />

<em>Maybe you’re a lie that I don’t need</em><br />
<em>Maybe you should listen when I speak</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>If you want scars, I’ll show you scars</em><br />
<em>All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark</em><br />
<em>If I were you, I’d be afraid</em><br />
<em>Cause everything you meant for guilt the cross has met with grace.</em></p>
<p>(“Under My Feet,” by Zach Williams, Track 6 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved son.

<p>The NLT reads, “who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.”</p>
<p>Walsh puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>Shame tells us we are worthless. Christ says, “I have made you worthy.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we don’t belong. Christ says, “You are mine.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we are dirty. Chris says, “I will wash you as white as snow.” </em>(p. 33).</p>
<p>If you struggle with guilt and shame, Christian counseling can help you deal with shame by providing a safe, non-judgmental space to get to the root causes from a faith-based perspective.</p>
<p>A counselor will use Bible-based principles, prayer, Scripture, and therapeutic approaches to help you reframe your self-image, find forgiveness, and develop a stronger relationship with God and others. The goal is to move past toxic shame by connecting with God’s grace and remember your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>So, back to “The Lion King.” When Nala finds the now adult Simba, she tells him he needs to come back to help take their home back from Scar. In the animated version, this conversation ensues between Simba and Rafiki:</p>
<p><strong>Simba:</strong> “I know what I have to do. But going back means I’ll have to face my past. I’ve been running from it for so long.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “It doesn’t matter. It’s in the past.”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “Yeah, but it still hurts.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it, or&#8230; learn from it.”</p>
<p>In the newer live/CGI action version this was the conversation that got me:</p>
<p><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I’m nobody.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Everybody is somebody. So, I ask again, who are you?”<br />
Simba hears Mufasa’s voice: “Simba, you must remember who you are: the one true king.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “And so, I asked&#8230;Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I am Simba, son of Mufasa.”</p>
<p>We must remember who and Whose we are.</p>
<p>As Rafiki said, “He lives in you.”</p>

<title>No Shame On You</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>One day, my then-thirteen-year-old daughter and I were playing around. She did something, and I jokingly said, “Shame on you!!” But something in my spirit quickened, and I said, “No! No shame on you! No shame in any of us once we have accepted Christ! Our shame is under the blood!”</p>
<p>Many people, even many Christians, deal with guilt and shame. What’s the difference between guilt and shame? I like the way Sheila Walsh explains it in her book <em>5 Minutes with Jesus: Making Today Matter</em>, “Guilt tells us that we’ve done something wrong; shame tells us that we <em>are</em> something wrong” (p. 32). But she also tells us that the antidote to shame is God’s love.</p>
<p>I love the song by Miranda Lambert (Country artist), “The House that Built Me.” She talks about going back to her childhood home to get some brokenness healed. It’s a gorgeous song. But it doesn’t fully resonate with me. For me, it was the opposite when I visited my hometown. I had bad memories, and condemnation would come in. The enemy would remind me of all the sin I had in my life before I came to Jesus.</p>
<p>One time after getting back from a trip to my hometown, I felt so much condemnation and regret, and I couldn’t shake it. Shortly after arriving home, our pastor at the time preached a message around Romans 8:1, “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” I needed that message at that exact moment. I’ve never forgotten it.</p>
<p>I needed that reminder. I needed that freedom, that release from the old chains being removed. Once I was reminded, I began to hold those negative thoughts captive and remind the enemy that my past was in the past. I have been redeemed. I don’t let the enemy hold my past over my head anymore.</p>
<p>There is a difference between conviction (correction) and condemnation. God whispers gentle reminders to us. It isn’t harsh. It’s a gentle and loving discipline from a good Father. The enemy, on the other hand, makes us feel awful and worthless when he comes at us with condemnation. He will come to us when we are most vulnerable. He’ll even tell us lies about ourselves that we start to believe.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:10 says Satan accuses the brethren day and night. The Bible also tells us, “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.”</p>
<p>What does he come to steal, kill, and destroy?</p>
<p>Steal: He robs people of their peace, joy, and security. He sows doubt and steals faith.</p>
<p>Kill: To extinguish spiritual life: This refers to a spiritual death, leading individuals away from salvation and an abundant life with God. To destroy self-worth and faith: The devil’s actions can kill one’s self-worth or faith in God.</p>
<p>Destroy: To cause chaos and despair: His goal is to bring about total devastation, division, chaos, corruption, and despair in creation and human relationships. To make people give up: By creating terrible situations, the devil tries to weaken a person’s will and make them feel hopeless that their life is over.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jesus wants us to have spiritual peace, joy, meaning, and purpose, which are what the devil seeks to destroy.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I watched The Lion King. I felt like it was an allegory of God, Jesus or us and the devil. Scar (Satan) tempts Simba (us) to go somewhere he isn’t supposed to go. Then, once he goes and there are consequences, he holds the blame over Simba’s head. He makes him feel guilty and unworthy. Even blaming him for something he didn’t even do. If you feel that same kind of guilt, that’s not from God.</p>
<p>The Bible says in Isaiah 43:25:</p>
<p>NLT &#8211; “I – yes, I alone – will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.”</p>
<p>NKJV- “I will not remember your sins!”</p>
<p>If He tells us He won’t remember them, why should we? If we sin and repent, it’s under the blood.</p>
<img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21596" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-shame-on-you.jpg" width="300" />We need to hold negative thoughts captive (as I mentioned before) and remind the devil that Jesus paid it all “…having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross” (Colossians 2:14).</p>
<p>The Bible, good devotionals, Christian music, and reminding myself who I am in Christ help me remember not to allow guilt and shame to try to creep in. There are so many good songs that remind us that God doesn’t want us to be stuck in a pit of shame.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs is “Made for More” by Jenn Johnson, Bethel Music, and Josh Baldwin. These lyrics get me every time:</p>
<p><em>Cause I wasn’t made to be tending a grave</em><br />
<em>I was called by name</em><br />
<em>Born and raised back to life again</em><br />
<em>I was made for more</em><br />
<em>So why would I make a bed in my shame</em><br />
<em>When a fountain of grace is running my way</em><br />
<em>I know I am Yours</em><br />
<em>And I was made for more.</em>
<p>(“Made for More,” by Josh Baldwin, featuring Jenn Johnson, on Josh Baldwin, <em>Made for More</em>,  Bethel Music, 2024)</p>
<p>The enemy used to try to help me make “a bed of shame” before I knew better.</p>
<p>There are two Zach Williams songs that also have helped me. On his “Rescue Story” album there is a song called “Slave to Nothing” which says:</p>
<p><em>You can tell me what I did</em><br />
<em>You  can show me who I was before</em><br />
<em>Where I fell short</em><br />
<em>Hang it over my head</em><br />
<em>But I’m not the same anymore</em><br />
<em>One thing’s for sure</em><br />
<em>The shackles have fallen</em><br />
<em>So, I’m showing shame to the door</em><br />
<em>Make no mistake.</em><br />
<em>I’m a slave to nothing.</em></p>
<p>(“Slave to Nothing,” by Zach Williams, Track 5 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<p>I also love this one by Zach Williams: “Under My Feet”</p>
<p><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>Those chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground</em><br />
<em>You can’t keep digging up my past</em><br />
<em>You may have had a laugh or two, but you don’t get the last</em><br />
<em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>[Chorus]</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was blind but now I see</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was bound but now I’m free</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>Maybe you’re a lie that I don’t need</em><br />
<em>Maybe you should listen when I speak</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>If you want scars, I’ll show you scars</em><br />
<em>All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark</em><br />
<em>If I were you, I’d be afraid</em><br />
<em>Cause everything you meant for guilt the cross has met with grace.</em></p>

If you feel that same kind of guilt, that’s not from God.</p>
<p>The Bible says in Isaiah 43:25:</p>
<p>NLT &#8211; “I – yes, I alone – will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.”</p>
<p>NKJV- “I will not remember your sins!”</p>
<p>If He tells us He won’t remember them, why should we? If we sin and repent, it’s under the blood.</p>
<img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21596" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-shame-on-you.jpg" width="300" />We need to hold negative thoughts captive (as I mentioned before) and remind the devil that Jesus paid it all “…having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross” (Colossians 2:14).</p>
<p>The Bible, good devotionals, Christian music, and reminding myself who I am in Christ help me remember not to allow guilt and shame to try to creep in. There are so many good songs that remind us that God doesn’t want us to be stuck in a pit of shame.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs is “Made for More” by Jenn Johnson, Bethel Music, and Josh Baldwin. These lyrics get me every time:</p>
<p><em>Cause I wasn’t made to be tending a grave</em><br />
<em>I was called by name</em><br />
<em>Born and raised back to life again</em><br />
<em>I was made for more</em><br />
<em>So why would I make a bed in my shame</em><br />
<em>When a fountain of grace is running my way</em><br />
<em>I know I am Yours</em><br />
<em>And I was made for more.</em>
<p>(“Made for More,” by Josh Baldwin, featuring Jenn Johnson, on Josh Baldwin, <em>Made for More</em>,  Bethel Music, 2024)</p>
<p>The enemy used to try to help me make “a bed of shame” before I knew better.</p>
<p>There are two Zach Williams songs that also have helped me. On his “Rescue Story” album there is a song called “Slave to Nothing” which says:</p>
<p><em>You can tell me what I did</em><br />
<em>You  can show me who I was before</em><br />
<em>Where I fell short</em><br />
<em>Hang it over my head</em><br />
<em>But I’m not the same anymore</em><br />
<em>One thing’s for sure</em><br />
<em>The shackles have fallen</em><br />
<em>So, I’m showing shame to the door</em><br />
<em>Make no mistake.</em><br />
<em>I’m a slave to nothing.</em></p>
<p>(“Slave to Nothing,” by Zach Williams, Track 5 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<p>I also love this one by Zach Williams: “Under My Feet”</p>
<p><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>Those chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground</em><br />
<em>You can’t keep digging up my past</em><br />
<em>You may have had a laugh or two, but you don’t get the last</em><br />
<em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>[Chorus]</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was blind but now I see</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was bound but now I’m free</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>Maybe you’re a lie that I don’t need</em><br />
<em>Maybe you should listen when I speak</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>If you want scars, I’ll show you scars</em><br />
<em>All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark</em><br />
<em>If I were you, I’d be afraid</em><br />
<em>Cause everything you meant for guilt the cross has met with grace.</em></p>
<p>(“Under My Feet,” by Zach Williams, Track 6 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved son. For in the Son all our sins are canceled, and we have the release of redemption through his very blood.</em> – <strong>Colossians 1:13-14, TPT</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The NLT reads, “who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.”</p>
<p>Walsh puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>Shame tells us we are worthless. Christ says, “I have made you worthy.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we don’t belong. Christ says, “You are mine.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we are dirty. Chris says, “I will wash you as white as snow.” </em>(p. 33).</p>
<p>If you struggle with guilt and shame, Christian counseling can help you deal with shame by providing a safe, non-judgmental space to get to the root causes from a faith-based perspective.</p>
<p>A counselor will use Bible-based principles, prayer, Scripture, and therapeutic approaches to help you reframe your self-image, find forgiveness, and develop a stronger relationship with God and others. The goal is to move past toxic shame by connecting with God’s grace and remember your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>So, back to “The Lion King.” When Nala finds the now adult Simba, she tells him he needs to come back to help take their home back from Scar. In the animated version, this conversation ensues between Simba and Rafiki:</p>
<p><strong>Simba:</strong> “I know what I have to do. But going back means I’ll have to face my past. I’ve been running from it for so long.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “It doesn’t matter. It’s in the past.”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “Yeah, but it still hurts.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it, or&#8230; learn from it.”</p>
<p>In the newer live/CGI action version this was the conversation that got me:</p>
<p><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I’m nobody.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Everybody is somebody. So, I ask again, who are you?”<br />
Simba hears Mufasa’s voice: “Simba, you must remember who you are: the one true king.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “And so, I asked&#8230;Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I am Simba, son of Mufasa.”</p>
<p>We must remember who and Whose we are.</p>
<p>As Rafiki said, “He lives in you.”</p>

<title>8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I surveyed several different parents and asked them to share a piece of advice for parenting teenagers. The most common initial response that I received was “I don’t know if I’m the right person to ask, I don’t know if I’m doing it right!”</p>
<p>After engaging in several of these conversations, it became clear that many parents feel a sense of being unsure in parenting teenagers. If you are one of those parents, you are not alone in this feeling! The good news is that all the advice that follows is simple to do; not easy, but simple and straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>Love through establishing boundaries/rules</strong></p>
<p>Establishment of boundaries refers to teaching a child right from wrong and good from evil. This may sound entirely too simple, but the value of this is essential, not only for young children, but especially for teenagers who enter a world where they have access to evil and the ability to choose what is wrong.</p>
<p>The more one is exposed to evil, the more important it is to know the difference between good and evil. Ideally, this teaching begins at a young age and establishes early on the difference between good and evil, as well as the truth that parents establishing boundaries and saying “no” is out of love for the child.</p>
<p>It is no accident that one of the first interactions between God and Adam and Eve is to establish boundaries. He clearly tells them what they are to do and what they are not to do. He clearly states the consequences and then remains with them as they experience the pain of those consequences.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life" class="alignleft wp-image-57275" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Rules without relationship lead to rebellion</strong></p>
<p>Setting rules in place without the establishment and deepening of a relationship will lead to a teen rebelling against the rules. Rules feel like punishment when there is no trust that the one setting the rules is doing it for your good.</p>
<p>It is important to have the relationship in place from a young age, and it is just as important to deepen that relationship when children move into their teenage years. The following pieces of advice are a great place to start in establishing and deepening your relationship with your teenager.</p>
<p><strong>Be present and available</strong></p>
<p>As teenagers venture into the world, they do take on more responsibilities and practice independence in many ways. Parents naturally allow them to do more things without supervision. Maybe they begin to cook their own food, be at the house alone, work at a job outside of the home, supervise their siblings, or spend time with friends without the supervision of parents.</p>
<p>There is a good and natural move toward more independence. Part of that independence is the teenager learning to seek help when they need it, instead of parents initiating this. All of us know that we are much more likely to seek the help of another when they indicate to us that they are available. One thing that parents can do is signal their availability if their teen wants to engage with them.</p>
<p>Availability without expectation of engaging is often what the teens need to reach out for help. One parent that I spoke to shared that she will try to be up when she knows that her teenager is up, in the few minutes before her teenager leaves the house for the day, just in case her teenager wants to talk through things.</p>
<p>This parent also shared that she would make sure that the radio is off when driving in the vehicle with her teen to leave open the opportunity for conversation. A teen often feels more comfortable speaking with an adult when some of the pressures of face-to-face conversations are lessened.</p>
<p><strong>Listen</strong></p>
<img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life 1" class="alignright wp-image-57276" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />This was the first piece of advice that a teenager gave me when I asked about good advice for parents of teenagers. She said that many of her friends have told her that they do not feel listened to by their parents. Often, interactions between parents and their teenagers can be emotional and tense. Moments like these make it difficult for any true listening to take place.</p>
<p>The important part of listening is being aware of how one is listening. One can listen to prepare their response, or one can listen to hear and understand the other person. In general, one feels most listened to when the other person is listening to understand and hear what the other person is saying.</p>
<p>One easy skill to bolster listening skills is to do what we call reflecting back. This is simple. You repeat the words that they just said back to the person. If done in a caring and genuine way, it allows the other person to trust that you are listening to them.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong>
<p>As teenagers move into the more adult and independent world, they need support and encouragement. The teenage years are often full of teens taking chances and being vulnerable as they stumble through choices in the adult world. The funny thing about teenagers is that they often hide their own insecurities as they step into this new world.</p>
<p>Though it is often hidden, the insecurities are there. It can be reassuring to receive encouragement as small successes are achieved. An easy phrase that means the world to teenagers is a genuine “I’m proud of you.” Teenagers long for some assurance that they are doing well in the adult world. They might present a self-assured attitude, but underneath, there is insecurity and longing for support.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57277" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Show care</strong></p>
<p>One of the most impactful statements from a young teenager that I interviewed was the following: “Don’t forget that we are still kids, we aren’t adults yet. We need parents to still take care of us and help us.” As teenagers enter the adult world, they can appear mature or project certainty even when they don’t feel mature or certain.</p>
<p>This can make it difficult for their parents to know how to help and care for them. My advice would be to fall back on basics. Check in on how your teenager is sleeping. Support a healthy bedtime routine. Check in on eating habits. Offer to prepare nourishing snacks or meals. Check in on emotional connections with others. Offer some one-on-one time with your teenager to talk about stresses or concerns. Continue to offer affection through physical touch.</p>
<p>This can feel awkward as your teenager grows into their adult body. This is needed now, more than ever. Continue to offer hugs, high fives, fist pumps, etc. Offer a pat on the back or your arm around their shoulder. Teenagers crave this connection, especially when their bodies might feel uncomfortable as they change with the onset of puberty. Continued physical affection from parents can allow a teenager to feel comfortable and confident in their own body.</p>
<p><strong>Dream big</strong></p>
<p>Encourage your teenager to dream big and not limit themselves. It feels safest to do what other people are doing or to only pursue things that are known and familiar. Encouraging your teenager to imagine bigger than what they know communicates two things to your teenager. The first thing it communicates is that you have confidence in the capacity and abilities of your teenager.</p>
<p>The second thing that it communicates is that the Lord has a plan for your teen that is much greater than your own. Ultimately, your teenager must learn to listen to the Lord and follow Him, without the voices of others getting too loud. This truth can also take some of the pressure that parents feel about having to figure out what their teenager plans to do with their life.</p>
<p><strong>Apologize</strong></p>
<img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life 3" class="alignright wp-image-57278" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-4-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Every relationship between humans involves rupture. A disconnection between two people. In healthy relationships, the rupture is followed by repair. The repair is a reconnection. Many times, the repair begins with an apology. Not only does this serve as the beginning of repair, but it is also how one takes responsibility for one&#8217;s own reactions and responses.</p>
<p>Discussions between parents and their teenagers can often get emotional. When words or tone of voice from the parent become disrespectful or hurtful, it is so important for the parent to apologize to their teenager about this.</p>
<p>It is always important for all of us to take responsibility for our words and actions. The age-old adage is true – kids care more about what adults do than what they say. When teenagers observe their parents apologizing and are at the receiving end of this, they learn how to do this themselves.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have shared eight different pieces of advice that I received from parents and teenagers about parenting teenagers. Although I cannot guarantee that these pieces of advice will change your life, I can guarantee that if these pieces of advice are taken to heart and implemented in your relationship with your teenager, it will deepen and strengthen your relationship with your teenager.</p>
<p>Deepening and strengthening a relationship with a teenager and parent will not just change those lives, but the lives of others in their family, and every life that your teenager meets. As Mother Teresa once said, “If you want to change the world, go home and love your family.”</p>

<title>Who Are You? The Quest to Be Your True Self</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>If you were asked the question, “Who are you?” would you have a precise answer? Likely not. I don’t think I could give one instantly and without some thoughtful hesitation. It puts one on the spot, and we are not often asked such fundamental questions as this. Perhaps it’s not even a fair question to spring on someone, but it is an important one for each of us to grapple with.</p>
<p>The rock group <em>The Who</em> asked the same question in their famous song, with the oft-repeated line, “Who are you, who, who, who, who…” and followed by, “I really want to know.” Though the original intent of the song wasn’t to pose such a philosophically existential question, the simplicity of the question has made it stick. It seems basic and straightforward, whether asking about oneself or someone else.</p>
<img alt="Who Are You? The Quest to Be Your True Self" class="alignleft wp-image-6921" height="300" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/who-are-you-the-quest-to-be-your-true-self-207x310.jpg" width="200" />Shakespeare wrote in <em>Hamlet</em>, “This above all, to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night and day, Thou canst not be false to any man.” It gets right to the heart of our lives. Much of our path through life is seeking an answer to this question. It’s relevant in our social circles, the people we meet, befriend, and love. Everyone wants to know this about us. Who are we, really?</p>
<p>In my work as a therapist, one of the things I seek to find is whether my client has a good sense of who they are. I want to know if that self is entangled inside various layers and levels of trying to be something or someone else, or if they are genuinely confused about who they are.</p>
<p>The reason I believe it’s important to get a sense of one’s sense of self is that it is through this self-knowledge that one can have a path to answering key questions and issues in their lives. When your true self is clearer, it can also be a path toward being closer to God and to other significant people, and it can provide a measure of peace.</p>

<p>(Adapted from YourDictionary.com &#8211; 2025)</p>
<p>These adjectives are useful in that they can pinpoint aspects of who we are, and we can identify with them most of the time. By finishing the sentence “I am …,” you are coming into better touch with your real self. Many of these can be aspirational.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to be kinder, but you feel the impulse to be judgmental much of the time, it might mean that there is kindness in you, but you are fearful of someone taking advantage of you.</p>
<p>If you find yourself apathetic, you might be wrestling with discouragement and wondering why you should care because you feel so defeated. But behind that apathy might be real caring. This might be closer to who you really are, if you dare to let that part of you be free.</p>
<p>I’ve seen people become paralyzed (or at least inhibited) by their intense concern for acceptance from other people. It’s also quite a natural thing to be concerned by what people think of us, and it’s not all bad. For example, dressing for some occasion, we often will modify our attire to fit what we think would be appropriate and acceptable.</p>
<p>But that fear of rejection is powerful, and when it modifies your behavior with others just to assure their acceptance, it can set you back in having the freedom to be yourself. Those fears often center around the failure to impress, failure to perform, or failure to meet the standards of the group. The fear of embarrassment can be a motivator to mold yourself into something other than your true self to gain that acceptance, or at least not be embarrassed.</p>
<img alt="Who Are You? The Quest to Be Your True Self 1" class="alignright wp-image-6922" height="200" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/who-are-you-the-quest-to-be-your-true-self-2-310x207.jpg" width="300" />Often, there is an internal fight between two voices, suggesting which way to go or how to be. One voice tells you to be freer and less afraid, to “be yourself.” The other tells you, “Don&#8217;t you dare be yourself, you will regret it.”</p>
<p>Richard Swartz, PhD, began a quest to better identify what the self really is and suggested that, in many ways, we are made up of various parts. Each part conducts a function that assists us to be our true selves, or other parts that seek to be overprotective and hinder us from being our true selves.</p>
<p>He suggests that we turn our focus inward to our “thoughts, emotions, fantasies, images, and sensations,” in other words, our inner experience. We often avoid these things because they might cause us discomfort or pain, and yet much is revealed about us when we turn our attention to expressing our own thoughts.</p>
<p>What we will find if we do this is often an internal dialogue between different parts of us. What might these parts be? There’s that part that is always polite, that part that wants to rebel, that part that is a follower of Christ, and that part that wants satisfy the flesh. There’s that performer and that part that says maybe you’re not good enough.</p>
<p>One thing that I appreciated about his theory of the self is how he shows the benefit of letting that true self come through. When a person allows their true self to come forward and lead their life, they project confidence that is strikingly present to others. That person is at ease with themselves, and others feel at ease around them. They are safe, relaxed, authentic, and unpretentious. We can be that person.</p>
<h3><strong>How do we get there?</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="Who Are You? The Quest to Be Your True Self 2" class="alignleft wp-image-6923" height="200" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/who-are-you-the-quest-to-be-your-true-self-3-310x207.jpg" width="300" />As a Christian, I have found it best to begin by acknowledging God in the process of discovering the true self. Psalm 139:23 says, “<em>Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts; And see if there is any hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way.”</em> First, God knows all, and any attempt to hide anything from Him doesn’t really make any sense.</p>
<p>Second, it drives one to honesty, and that leads to peace. To top that, just a few verses before this, it says one of the most powerful statements of our creation, that we are not some accident when the psalmist says, “<em>I will give thanks to Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Thy works, And my soul knows it well.”</em> There is great comfort in embracing the truth of God’s knowing us, creating us, and loving us unconditionally.</p>
<p>As we rest in knowing that we, with all our failings, are His children, then we can find the courage to let our true selves free. Beyond that step is to become more aware of your thoughts and emotions. The practice of metacognition is thinking about your thinking.</p>
<p>In that process, we might find our thinking is poisoning the well. Becoming self-aware is step one. This is not exactly effortless. It requires taking some time to be undistracted. One practical way is to begin to journal your thoughts, experiences, and musings about those experiences; to determine each day to catch yourself thinking, and then simply ask yourself, what was I just thinking.</p>
<p>It takes a certain amount of courage to be honest with yourself and examine what is going on. Are you justifying actions that you have taken or will take? Are you fantasizing about something unhealthy, or perseverating about an event or a conversation? Is your thinking beginning to trigger some emotions like anger?</p>
<p>When you can catch yourself in these thought loops, you can choose to halt the perseveration by mentally jumping out of that loop and concentrating on something else. The way to do this is to begin with the box breathing: four slow counts in through your nose, hold for two to four counts, and slowly breathe out through your mouth.</p>
<p><img alt="Who Are You? The Quest to Be Your True Self 3" class="alignright wp-image-6924" height="300" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/who-are-you-the-quest-to-be-your-true-self-4-207x310.jpg" width="200" />Concentrate on the sound and feeling of the breaths, and you will find your concentration has shifted. Continue with that and begin to direct your thinking to something that brings contentment, joy, a pleasant memory, like a prized vacation spot, the ocean, or the woods, and sit there for a while.</p>
<p>From there, begin to take those traits mentioned above and speak to yourself, “I am fundamentally kind, I am fair, I am honest, I am creative, I am smart,” and so on. “I am who I am, and I don’t need to fit into someone else’s mold.” Does this mean that you don’t acknowledge faults or weaknesses? No, but it can help you begin to accept those not as dominant traits, but areas that need to be worked on. There’s quite a difference.</p>
<p>Plus, if you are a believer in Christ, you have the Holy Spirit to help you be the person you strive to be. The result is greater freedom, peace, and rest. “<em>Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.”</em> (Hebrews 4;1)</p>
<p>This is merely an introduction to the process of better knowing and being your true self. If you find yourself in a long struggle to be yourself with others and are disappointed in yourself for not being free to be that person, I will feel privileged to work with you and help you find readily available peace.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>It seems to me that we are surrounded by conflict: financial, political, family, personal, mechanical, and digital. Conflict, I think, is a byproduct of a fallen world.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. –</em> <strong>James 4:</strong><strong>1-3</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This week, I have a larger-than-usual list of couples experiencing significant conflicts. Why do we end up in conflict with those who are particularly important to us? Most couples say they love each other, but have a tough time communicating love and compassion</p>
<h3>What the Bible Says</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful</em>. – <strong>Colossians 3:12-14</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Most people would like to be at peace. At least that&#8217;s what we say. I have noticed that there are times when I simply want my own way, and I don’t like the way things are. I lose sight of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>We have everything we need: money, opportunity, a lovely home, and children, and yet we’re not happy if we don’t have peace in our marriage. I feel excited at the prospect of helping new couples and working through the challenges ahead, but high-conflict couples can sometimes strain my capabilities.</p>
<p>Highly conflicted couples are often engaged in intense power struggles, each trying to get something from their mate, yet doing so in ways that create the problem. They demand, blame, punish, and coerce, hardly noticing their actions are fueling the fire.</p>
<img alt="Helping Highly Conflicted Couples Through Christian Couples Therapy" class="alignleft wp-image-57266" height="169" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helping-highly-conflicted-couples-through-christian-couples-therapy-500x281.jpg" width="300" />Fortunately, Author and psychologist Marshall Rosenberg wrote in his book, Nonviolent Communication, that highly conflicted couples are trapped in power struggles with one another.</p>
<p>He suggests that people use “life-alienating language” filled with judgments about rightness and wrongness, goodness and badness, judgment, diagnosis, and self-righteousness, without hearing the values that the other holds. Couples who try to control each other end up in conflict, whereas couples who accept one another are much more likely to connect.</p>
<h3>Common Dynamics of Highly Conflicted Couples</h3>
<p>Highly conflicted couples often find themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locked into oppositional stances</li>
<li>Frequently angry with one another</li>
<li>Poor conflict-resolution/communication skills</li>
<li>Poor impulse control</li>
<li>Tend to blame and fault-find</li>
<li>Have rigidly held beliefs about their partner</li>
<li>Offering little insight into their contribution to their problems</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find yourself doing these things, here are a few suggestions on how to work your way out of that.</p>
<p><strong>Change the focus</strong>
<p>When a couple is struggling, they often come into a meeting with a list of complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe the Conversation</strong></p>
<p>Reframe the conversation away from being about what their spouse is or isn’t doing to thinking about their relationship bond.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love– </em><strong>1 John 4:7-8</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Create positive interactions</strong></p>
<p>It’s much easier to do something positive than to work through all the negative.. What can you do to build your connection?”</p>
<p>Questions to ask: What do you do that improves your bond? What do you do that tears down your bond? What will be the impact on your bond if you continue in these behaviors? What are you willing to do to improve?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! – </em><strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Increase validation</strong></p>
<p>Try to understand what is really going on with each other, listen to thoughts and feelings, and validate one another. To really understand each other, we need to uncover each other&#8217;s emotional needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” – </em><strong>Galatians 5:14</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Recognize emotional triggers</strong></p>
<p>Emotional triggers are what frequently fuel many of our conflicts. Our spouse says something, and it triggers us. It is easier to be compassionate and to have empathy for your partner. If you understand that you are reacting that way because that’s the way your dad reacted, often our reactions are messages from Our Childhood</p>
<p><strong>Identify conflict patterns</strong></p>
<p>Couples often seek help because they are fighting; conflict is not usually about solving the problem, it is about how you treat one another.</p>
<p><strong>Build intimacy</strong></p>
<p>Three topics usually lead to a couple conflict: communication, conflict management, and physical intimacy. So much of what needs to happen for couples is to simply have a safe environment where they can talk about their needs, their wants, what is working, and how they might want to increase the intimacy in the bedroom</p>
<p><strong>Process resentment</strong></p>
<p>Resentment can build up over time. At the core of resentment is not being able to forgive. We hold the hurts and pains internally, and then they pop up again and impact our current relationship. Sometimes, resentment and unforgiveness build up over time.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a process. It looks like this: It is a choice, you can feel hurt, but you choose not to hold on to the hurt. You don’t just forget, but we learn to trust again. We develop compassion for our loved ones, and we let go of bitterness. We don’t emotionally shut down</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. </em></p>
<p><em>And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things. – </em><strong>Philippians 4:4-8</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>To conclude. I suggest we pray for each other and focus on helping our spouse be better. Give with no expectation of getting back. Marriage is not <em>quid pro quo</em>. If you remember your vows, there were no caveats. No “if-then” clauses. There were promises “till death parts us.”</p>
<p>These are sacred, and God will help us with them. If you are struggling, take some serious time to pray, find a counselor, a pastor, or a Christian friend. In my experience, everything changes over time. Give God some time to make it better, and watch it change and get better. Every change changes everything.</p>

<title>Defining the Types of Domestic Violence</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Before beginning this article, this writer would like to state clearly and unequivocally that all relationships should be free of any form of abuse. In addition, all forms of intimate partner violence (also known as domestic violence) are unacceptable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, brutal fights and regrettable incidents happen and leave horrific scars on a relationship. Often, these lesser forms of conflict, as mentioned in the last sentence, still can have bitter and destructive language and controlling behavior. The key difference between domestic violence and conflict in a relationship is the amount of control exerted.</p>
<p>Between relationship conflicts and domestic violence, some grey areas are hard to distinguish. For example, verbally abusive language during a domestic dispute may occur, but the conflict cools, and the couple makes the necessary amends. On the other hand, one or both partners may not make amends, and resentment builds up between them.</p>
<h3>Situational Domestic Violence</h3>
<p>Resentment can still lead to domestic violence, especially when it accumulates, and the partners do not resolve it. In these situations, violence becomes situational. In situational domestic violence, one or both partners end a conflict with violence based on a particular situation. Situational domestic violence is generally minor in intensity compared to other forms of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Situational domestic violence can also occur when things suddenly get out of control, and one or both partners begin to engage in domestic violence. Both forms of situational violence often occur because the partners are poor communicators without using verbal or physical aggression. As stated above, situational domestic violence is still domestic violence and a criminal act. Using violence to resolve conflict is always improper.</p>
<p>Fortunately, situational domestic violence is treatable. Situational domestic violence is often a wake-up call to both partners that there are issues that need to be resolved. While it would be preferable for a couple to act proactively to prevent situational domestic violence, a therapist can still examine the root causes of the situation and help a couple to problem-solve these domestic disputes.</p>
<img alt="Defining the Types of Domestic Violence" class="alignleft wp-image-6913" height="300" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/defining-the-types-of-domestic-violence-207x310.jpg" width="200" />The prognosis for the relationship is good, especially if a couple acts quickly and continues to use the skills given to them.</p>
<p>By contrast, other forms of domestic violence are more serious than situational domestic violence. Other forms of domestic violence display a pattern of abuse. Even though the pattern is not universally true for all abusers, Walker (1979) found that tension builds up, an outburst of violence occurs, the batterer attempts reconciliation, the relationship returns to calm until the tension builds up again, and the cycle repeats itself.</p>
<p>Although not all relationships follow this exact pattern, the end goal is to obtain some form of control over the battered individual. In some relationships, there is no reconciliation between the batterer and the battered. In these situations, the batterer minimizes the violence and/or denies that it took place.</p>
<p>The impact on battered women is more severe physically and psychologically.* Battered women who experience these forms of domestic violence are often seriously injured, permanently disabled, or killed. Psychological impact on battered women creates depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The financial cost of treating batterers and battered women each year is staggering.</p>
<p>In 1998, Jacobson and Gottman published their research on the relationship between batterers and battered women. In <em>When Men Batter Women</em>, the authors discovered that there were two types of characterological batterers: cobras and pit bulls. Both cobras and pit bulls use physical aggression to control, bully, and overpower their wives. Both cobras and pit bulls injure their wives and instill fear in them.</p>
<h3>Cobras</h3>
<p>A cobra is a venomous snake found in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. They are known for standing up and striking quickly at their prey. In Asia and India, individuals often charm these snakes with their flutes.</p>
<p>Cobras have similar characteristics to a cobra snake. Therapists often see them bob their head from side to side as they listen to the therapist. They are trying to charm the therapist with their feigned attention. Cobras tend to strike their wives quickly and hard with little or no notice.</p>
<p>Jacobson and Gottman found that cobras became calmer before they battered their wives. In other words, as the conflict continued, their blood pressure dropped. Cobras frequently have been pre-conditioned from adverse childhood experiences to remain calm. Because of their calm demeanor and chilling manipulativeness, their wives do not detect their venom until it is too late.</p>
<p>Because cobras can be deceptively pleasant and calm, Jacobson and Gottman discovered that they can trick and mislead police officers not to arrest them, judges to give them lighter sentences, and therapists to give them favorable reports.</p>
<p>They are usually highly intelligent individuals who know how to say the right thing, at the right time, and at the right place. As a result, couples therapy is contraindicated for these individuals. They rarely reform through programs or counseling. The effective way to treat a Cobra is to impose a hefty sentence and allow him to sit in jail.</p>
<p>According to Jacobson and Gottman, cobras are particularly dangerous because they typically have criminal, antisocial traits. In addition to battering their wives, cobras often have physical altercations with others.</p>
<p>They show little or no remorse for their actions. Cobras often feel that the law does not apply to them, and they make the rules. Although pit bulls inflict violence on their wives, cobras tend to batter their wives more severely and are more likely to involve weapons and/or death threats.</p>
<p>Cobras assert control in their relationship because they want things done on their timetable. Control also means that the cobra makes the rules. These rules involve (1) not accepting influence or being told what to do by their wives, (2) opposing any rules established by the wife, (3) accepting sex as the only form of intimacy, and (4) refusing any personal changes.</p>
<p>Cobras batter their wives in three steps: (1) they make emotionally abusive statements initially, (2) they gain control of their wives through savage abuse and/or explosive anger, and (3) they justify their actions by teaching their wives that they are in control. Control means that he is the king of his castle without any co-regents, and his wife is his servant.</p>
<p>Because of their charm, controlling tactics, lack of remorse, and deception, wives of cobras have more difficulty leaving their cobra husbands than pit bull husbands. These wives optimistically hope that their husbands will change. The abuse by cobras is equally a psychological and physical stripping away of any self-esteem and self-respect. Their lack of remorse instills the real fear that their husbands will maim, paralyze, or kill them.</p>
<h3>Pit Bulls</h3>
<p>Pit bulls are several species of dogs descended from bulldogs and terriers. In the last twenty-five years, pit bulls have been demonized by society for their vicious attacks on human beings. They are described as dangerous, unpredictable, and easily angered. Their bites are vicious, leading to frequent disfiguration and some deaths, especially among young children and vulnerable older adults.</p>
<p>Like their canine counterparts, Jacobson and Gottman observed that pit bulls strike their wives hard with overwhelming force and refuse to let go until they are done abusing their wives. Pit bulls are territorial, becoming jealous, paranoid, and obsessive as they fear that their spouse is going to leave them. Therapists will often recognize pit bulls as they lean forward toward the therapist or their wives.</p>
<p>Jacobson and Gottman discovered that the anger of pit bulls is slower than that of cobras, which strike quickly. They tend to be like a slow-burning candle. Their blood pressure rises until they become violent with their wives. Once pit bulls begin to batter, they are vicious and do not stop until their anger subsides.</p>
<p><img alt="Defining the Types of Domestic Violence 1" class="alignright wp-image-6914" height="240" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/defining-the-types-of-domestic-violence-2-310x248.jpg" width="300" />Unlike cobras, Jacobson and Gottman found that most Pit Bulls direct their aggression primarily at their owners. They feel some guilt for their actions, but they frequently project their anger toward their wives. In other words, they blame their wives for provoking them. In addition, pit bulls accuse their wives of causing them to lose their tempers.</p>
<p>Pit bulls are also known for DARVO. DARVO stands for Deny/Defend, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender. Pit bulls portray themselves as victims and the battered wife as the perpetrator. When pit bulls perceive themselves as victims, they often become depressed.</p>
<p>Jacobson and Gottman discovered that pit bulls tend to be less antisocial and criminally driven. As stated above, they do feel some remorse for their actions as they return to calm. Their problem is two-fold: (1) they are extremely dependent and clingy to their wives, and (2) they have a fear of being abandoned. As a result, they have a deep desire to control their wives. Pit bulls’ wives describe their husbands as having the maturity of a small child.</p>
<p>Because pit bulls feel this need to control their wives, Jacobson and Gottman pointed out that Pit Bulls tend to isolate and use mind control on their wives. Pit bulls tend to gaslight their wives to gain mind control. Controlling their wives’ lives means closely scrutinizing their every move and turning them into marionettes.</p>
<p>They have abnormal fears of infidelity by their wives because they are afraid of abandonment. Wives of pit bulls often feel frustrated as their husbands demand change, but their husbands discount their wives’ efforts to change, creating a double blind. Like cobras, they do not accept influence from their wives or like being told what to do. Pit bulls will use violence and entrapment to assert control.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, it is easier for a pit bull wife to leave. However, pit bulls become more abusive and violent when they believe that their wives are leaving them. They may stalk their wives for years afterwards. Pit bulls are even more violent with their wives after separation or divorce.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Unlike the situational domestic batterers, couples therapy is generally contraindicated for characterological batterers, because couples therapy focuses on responsibility for both partners. Domestic violence is not the responsibility of battered women. Cobras, as described above, are too antisocial and manipulative for couples therapy to be effective.</p>
<p>Couples therapy is effective for only a limited number of pit bulls. Several conditions must be met before couples therapy is effective for pit bulls. First, a pit bull must successfully complete a court-mandated group responsibility treatment. Second, there must be at least six months of no domestic violence toward the battered wife. Third, the battered wife must be willing to wait for the pit bull to meet the previous two conditions for couples therapy to begin.</p>
<p>Even though a pit bull completes group responsibility treatment, and there has been six months of no domestic violence after group responsibility treatment, many battered women choose to flee this situation.</p>
<p>For a battered woman to leave a cobra or a pit bull, it may take some time to safely leave due to these types of characterological batterers. A counselor specifically trained in domestic violence would assist battered women with exiting a dangerous domestic situation. Please note that leaving a domestic violence situation takes time, deliberate planning, and can be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>David writes in Psalm 7:9 (NIV): “Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure – you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts.” According to KXLY radio (October 22, 2025), one out of three women and one out of ten men will experience domestic violence in Spokane County. At Spokane Christian Counseling, we share the prayer of David.</p>
<p>We pray that violence toward battered individuals will stop. We ask God to protect the wounded women who bravely survive life-threatening situations. We petition God to prick the minds and hearts of batterers. At Spokane Christian Counseling, we have therapists who can help in your journey. Please reach out to us if we can assist you.</p>
<p>Individuals at the National Domestic Violence Hotline are available 24 hours a day at 800-799-7233. Battered individuals can find additional resources at www.loveisrespect.org.</p>

*I recognize that women can batter men. Because women batterers tend to be less violent and the field of female batterers has little research, this writer will limit his comments to the dynamic between male batterers and battered females. Even though female batterers use more psychological abuse, generalizations comparing female batterers to Cobras would not be advised, because there is a lack of widespread research into the behaviors of female batterers.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-1 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-0 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-1"><p>You don’t always know what you’re getting into in the early stages of a relationship. Some people mask their problematic personality traits so well that years later, they seem like completely different people. On top of this, they might manipulate and gaslight you into thinking that <em>you’re</em> the one with the issue, and that they are persevering with you.</p>
<p>The good news is that you are not going crazy, and this is a common tactic of narcissistic people. The difficult news is that it takes practice to recognize the key traits of a narcissistic partner, and the work has only just begun once you’ve correctly identified them.</p>
<h3>The Undercover Boss</h3>
<p>It can be hard to truly know the person we have connected our lives to. This is truer of narcissists than it is of other personality types. One of the reasons people struggle to identify narcissism is that narcissists are so good at making themselves likable to everyone else, only for the mask to slip when you are alone with them.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6323" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sander-sammy-q7ZlbWbDnYo-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Every narcissist has an uncontrollable desire to be liked, loved, and centered. This differs from people-pleasers who will ingratiate themselves, give up their power, and diminish their boundaries to gain acceptance. By contrast, narcissists want the power, notoriety, and attention because they believe they are entitled to it.</p>
<p>This type of narcissism is called grandiose narcissism, or overt narcissism. People with this personality type are often in positions of power, such as being the heads of corporations, leaders at the top, or bosses lording it over underlings.</p>
<p>Overt narcissists are self-centered, emotionally underdeveloped, entitled people who are triggered by criticism but thrive on praise. Many of them know that these qualities are not palatable, and that they will “catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,” as the old saying goes. For this reason, they are also expert manipulators.</p>
<p>Whether it is a team of workers or a romantic partner, overt narcissists know how to mask their unsavory characteristics and magnify their positives. They will use their magnetism and communication skills to win people’s loyalty until they are surrounded by people who are captivated by them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the ruse only lasts until they meet disagreement, challenge, or someone who rivals their charm. At their core, overt narcissists lack empathy and will do anything to stay on top. They can effortlessly switch from being charismatic and charming to being cold, cruel, and calculating.</p>
<p>The same tongue that charms people into submission also cuts, shames, and threatens. The switch-up can be sudden and shocking, and leave you wondering who this person is, even though you thought you knew them.</p>
<h3>Hidden Dragon</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6324" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/eric-ward-7KQe_8Meex8-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The second flavor of narcissism is the vulnerable narcissist, or the covert narcissist. Unlike their counterparts, covert narcissists tend to appear anxious, introverted, shy, and even fragile. The primary trait of an overt narcissist is that they demand loyalty. By contrast, the core trait of covert narcissists is that they fear rejection. They are as manipulative and controlling of their partners, but they tend to use guilt, shame, and gaslighting to gain the advantage.</p>
<p>What makes covert narcissists so obviously fragile is their low self-esteem and hypersensitivity. Not only do they constantly crave validation and admiration, but they also react strongly to perceived criticism and imagined slights.</p>
<p>They are emotionally volatile people who will frequently take on the persona of victimhood if it means that they can avoid criticism, blame, or accountability. What solidifies their status as a narcissist is that they lack empathy for others and insist on centering themselves in everything.</p>
<p>Covert narcissists are not unlike the many types of predatory animals that camouflage themselves to avoid detection. Overt narcissists thrive on being the center of everyone’s attention, and to an extent, don’t care how people see them so long as they are being seen and heard.</p>
<p>On the other hand, covert narcissists tend to focus all of their manipulation tactics on one or a few people, ensuring at any cost that they are kept central and important to those selected few. They learn how to most effectively ensnare these people with delicate emotional manipulation and careful posturing. Lacking empathy means that they don’t truly care for those who are closest to them, provided that they don’t hold them accountable or walk out on them.</p>
<h3>The Key Traits of Narcissistic Partners</h3>
<p>Being in a relationship with a narcissist is different from working for one or being a peer with one. It’s not always so simple to leave the relationship, and confronting them with their toxicity will often result in them becoming volatile and turning it around on you.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6325" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sivani-b-bczrpU9n8f4-unsplash-scaled-1-169x300.jpg" width="169" />Before you even consider what to do about the situation, however, you will benefit from decisively identifying your partner as a narcissist, whether they are overt or covert. Months and years of gaslighting are only ended by the truth, and in this case, the truth truly will set you free.</p>
<p>Overt narcissists see themselves as superior, and in their minds, they are the head and leader of the relationship. They require your submission, recognition, and appreciation. If this status quo is challenged or questioned, they will reassert their dominance, sometimes in volatile and even violent ways.</p>
<p>For this reason, they tend to pick their partners carefully, choosing submissive people who will be content to follow and obey the rule of law in the relationship. Many of them use their intelligence and personal insight to manipulate their partners into agreement, ensuring the continuation of a relationship that only serves them.</p>
<p>It is relatively simple to identify an overt narcissist in a relationship; however, years of emotional manipulation and domination might obscure the facts. Any kind of power imbalance in a romantic relationship or platonic friendship should be a red flag. Giving someone power over you is a way of saying that you are less valuable than they are, which is never the truth.</p>
<p>Confrontations and disagreements happen in any relationship, and they can be necessary and helpful. However, if you reflect on all the fights you’ve had and realize that you are the one in the wrong, and your partner is always blameless, you might be in a relationship with a covert narcissist.</p>
<p>Covert narcissists are highly sensitive to criticism, correction, and even feedback. They might be more subtle in the way they dominate the relationship, but they tend to have complete control of the narrative. In their narrative, they are always blameless and always the victim of your wrongdoing.</p>
<p>You may have been gaslit into thinking that you need to keep them in your life because they love you despite your many flaws. However, ask yourself this: <em>If you are constantly in the wrong and </em><em>you have caused so much emotional damage to your partner, then why are they still with you?</em></p>
<p>No one can love someone who constantly hurts them. The more logical explanation is that they need you to believe their version of the truth, which always centers on their needs and preferences.</p>
<h3>Freedom And Scars</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6326" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-240x300.jpg" width="240" />Being in a relationship with a narcissistic partner has likely made you feel small, insignificant, and as if you are a collection of problems. Depending on how long and involved the relationship was, you have likely sustained a fair amount of emotional and psychological damage. It might take some time and work, but you can find truth, freedom, and healing.</p>
<p>When a person breaks a limb, they might carry a scar for the rest of their life. Even when the fracture heals, they are left with a scar as a reminder of the experience. A similar thing happens when we are emotionally traumatized in a relationship. We may carry painful memories for years, but eventually, all that will remain is a painless scar as a reminder of that experience. You are not trapped. Freedom lies on the other side, just beyond your reach right now.</p>
<h3>Find Freedom with Support</h3>
<p>Sometimes we need a little extra help to get through things. If step one is identifying your partner as a narcissistic abuser, perhaps step two could be meeting with a counselor to discover your next step. If you would like to meet with a counselor, please contact us, and we can connect you with one.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The fear of abandonment can develop in early childhood or later in life. When someone you love and is supposed to love you leaves, it etches a silent message to your mind: I’m unloved, unwanted, and not worthy of attention.</p>
<p>These messages could not be further from the truth. The Bible states that God knew you from before you were born. He created you and already had a plan for your life from before your birth.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well…Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.</em> <strong>– Psalm 139:13-14, 16, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Your worth is not the result of another person’s actions. God will never leave you nor forsake you. He is faithful, and His mercy endures forever. You can lay the fear of abandonment at His feet.</p>
<h3>Tips for Overcoming the Fear of Abandonment</h3>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment.jpg"><img alt="fear of abandonment " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-64181" height="199" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment.jpg" width="300" /></a>It is possible to overcome the fear of abandonment, but it will take time for healing and to replace negative thoughts and limiting beliefs. You may still have days when you question your own worth. However, with the right type of counseling, you will develop healthy coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>Don’t allow the fear of abandonment to flow through your family. You can break the generational cycle by addressing your anxiety now. Healing your heart and allowing Jesus to take the place of any person will overflow onto your children and grandchildren, leaving behind a legacy of healing and love.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t hide from your feelings</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge your feelings and have a safe space to express the hurt, anger, and frustration. Coming to terms with what happened does not mean that you are at fault. Instead, it is a part of the healing process. Unprocessed emotions can manifest into physical and mental conditions and create trouble in other relationships.</p>
<p>Journaling is an effective tool for expressing your thoughts and feelings. It allows you to write on the page what you would like to say to the other person. Having an outlet for these emotions helps you to move past them as you live your life. Don’t hide from your feelings. Express them on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Work on negative thoughts and limiting beliefs</strong></p>
<p>Abandonment embeds negative thoughts and limiting beliefs into the psyche. For example, you may carry the hateful words someone you love spoke to you. These words become part of your narrative and your belief system. If they stated that no one would love you, then you might believe no one will ever love you. This thought pattern can cause self-sabotage in relationships.</p>
<p>Identifying negative thoughts and limiting beliefs is the first step. Using a journal or small notebook, jot down every thought that brings you emotional pain or self-sabotage. Catch these thoughts and challenge them.</p>
<p>Are these factual statements, or simply the regurgitation of someone bitter and hurting? Have you surmised these beliefs based on this person’s actions? Ask a counselor to help you identify and replace negative thoughts and limiting beliefs with more helpful ones.</p>
<p><strong>Nurture meaningful relationships</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-2.jpg"><img alt="fear of abandonment " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-86108" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-2.jpg" width="300" /></a>When someone you love leaves, you might wonder if it’s worth the effort to invite others into your circle. No one wants to be hurt again. Yet, there is no proof that you will or will not be hurt again. People are human. We are all flawed. However, what we can do is form meaningful relationships and nurture them to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>We can let people in and take a chance. What relationships should you nurture? The people who have stuck by you, or the new person in town, or at your church. Find common ground with them and ask God to give you discernment to let the right ones in for His glory and your peace.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to set boundaries</strong></p>
<p>If you have faced the fear of abandonment, then you may fall into the people-pleasing rut. You want to feel love and acceptance, so you bend your rules and values for other people. You allow others to take advantage of your kindness and generosity. Although we should always approach people with love and kindness, we must set boundaries to protect our peace and mental health.</p>
<p>Make it clear about people’s access to you. There will be people you need to forgive, but you cannot make them a daily part of your life due to past hurts or betrayals. Set boundaries with those in your life. Identify the behaviors you will not tolerate and clearly communicate them to others.</p>
<p><strong>Make honest communication a priority</strong></p>
<p>Keep communication open with the people who matter the most to you. Honest communication can often be emotionally draining during difficult conversations, but maintaining open lines of communication can lead to forgiveness and healing.</p>
<p>Don’t feel like a solution must be found right away. Take a breather and question whether you may be falling back into old behavioral patterns due to abandonment issues. Speak with a counselor if you need to develop your communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>Consider talk therapy</strong></p>
<p>It’s easy to lie to ourselves. We tell ourselves a story to make life bearable while we deal with the fear of abandonment. Talk therapy is an excellent format for uncovering the root cause of anxiety and finding ways to manage the thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>A counselor leads talk therapy and provides you with a safe space to express your pain and the thoughts and emotions that are holding you back. This is also an opportunity to discuss negative thoughts and limiting beliefs, and learn healthy coping mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Research Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong></p>
<p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a method that helps break negative thoughts and emotions, reframing them into healthier ones, thereby changing behaviors. CBT also works in reverse. When you identify an unhealthy or harmful behavior, CBT helps you change not only the behavior itself but also the thoughts associated with it and the resulting emotions.</p>
<p>You will need to see a mental health professional to begin CBT. CBT is effective for helping people with various mental conditions, including anxiety, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and eating disorders.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-3.jpg"><img alt="Christian Counseling " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-86109" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-3.jpg" width="300" /></a><strong>Turn your story into a testimony in group therapy</strong></p>
<p>Although it is painful, everyone has a story to tell. You don’t know how much your story of abandonment or neglect may impact another life. Turn your story into a testimony and seek support and encouragement from others in group therapy.</p>
<p>You can often find group therapy at local counseling centers, community centers, hospitals, and online. Many people like a virtual option, where they can participate from the comfort of their own home while engaging with others.</p>
<p><strong>Take time out for yourself</strong></p>
<p>If you struggle with abandonment issues, you may find yourself giving more to others than to yourself. This is a natural response to the fear of abandonment. You are afraid that if you do not please others, they might leave.</p>
<p>But you cannot pour from an empty cup. Eventually, you will burn out. Taking time out for yourself is not selfish; it’s self-care. It’s protecting your peace and health, so that you can be there for others. Think of activities that make you happy or leave you with a sense of accomplishment. Some suggestions include going for a long walk, visiting a park or museum, or curling up with a good book. Try to do something specifically for you once or twice a day.</p>

<title>5 Signs of OCD in Adults</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) affects an estimated six million adults in the United States. Most people recognize a few of the signs of OCD in adults, such as obsessively ordering items to relieve anxiety. Still, they may not realize that other signs, such as hoarding, can interfere with daily life. The obsessive and compulsive behaviors can disrupt relationships and work.</p>
<h3>Looking for Signs of OCD in Adults</h3>
<p>If you are worried that you or a loved one has developed Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, you need to learn the signs of OCD in adults. These obsessions and compulsions operate in a cyclical pattern. Thoughts become obsessive, and the person feels anxious. In response to this anxiety, they react compulsively, doing something to feel better momentarily. These OCD cycles can consume a significant amount of time throughout the day.</p>
<p>The following are five common signs of OCD in adults.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Wanting Everything To Be Orderly</strong><br />
One of the most common signs of OCD in adults is aligning or ordering items to bring a sense of control to a situation. It may be the inside of the pantry, a closet, bathroom towels, or candies. The ordering may be by product, label, color, shape, or texture. Each item must match in symmetry. When the person sees order, they feel more in control and less anxious.</p>
<p><strong> 2. Uncontrollable Thoughts</strong><br />
<img alt="5 Signs of OCD in Adults" class="alignleft wp-image-32787" height="200" src="https://lachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-signs-of-ocd-in-adults-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Someone with OCD may experience intrusive and disturbing thoughts. These upsetting thoughts may be about themselves or others. They imagine themselves hurting someone they love. To counteract intrusive thoughts, they may adopt rituals, such as repeating a mantra or prayer. They may believe that if they do not complete their ritual, these thoughts will come true.</p>
<p><strong> 3. Excessive Worry About Getting Sick</strong><br />
If you suffer from OCD, you may excessively worry about germs and getting sick. You may obsess over cleanliness. Excessive handwashing, sanitizing, and cleaning may take up too much of your time. You may not be able to socialize with others or feel awkward when you shake hands. You may spend hours cleaning daily until you feel confident that you have eradicated any germs.</p>
<p><strong> 4. Excessive Fear of Being Hurt</strong><br />
When you worry about being hurt or a loved one harmed to the point of excessiveness, you become anxious and stressed. You imagine scenarios and may call a loved one several times until they arrive safely home. You may be too frightened to leave home or go on any trips. You may question strangers’ motives when you do go out. You constantly check appliances, locks, and doors, and call your family. You may create a ritual for checking these things to protect yourself and others.</p>
<p><strong> 5. Needing Reassurances and Approval</strong><br />
OCD signs interfere with relationships at work and home. The obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors cause you to seek reassurance and approval from others. You may ask repeatedly about your appearance or your home. Hoarding is a subtype of OCD, and you may seek approval from others to justify bringing one more thing into the home.</p>
<h3>Christian Counseling for OCD in Los Angeles</h3>

<title>How to Manage Depression and Anger: 5 Practical Tips</title>
<link>https://orangecountychristiancounseling.com/articles/how-to-manage-depression-and-anger-5-practical-tips</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>You may carry a lot of anger from what someone did to you, how you expected life to turn out, or the loss of a loved one. Grief, loss, trauma, abuse, or betrayal are only a few of the triggers for anger. They are also triggers for depression. Depression and anger often coexist.</p>
<h3>Depression and Anger Management Tips</h3>
<p>Since you can struggle with depression and anger, you need to learn how to manage both conditions. Some of the suggestions below work on both conditions, and you can make them part of your daily routine to minimize symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Recognize triggers</strong> If you know your triggers, you can find ways to manage or minimize their effects on you. Identify the ones that worsen your depression and anger symptoms.</p>
<p>For example, if you are taking college classes online and are behind this term, leading you to feel sad or angry with thoughts of not being able to keep up, speak to the school’s guidance counselor.</p>
<p>Being behind in class may trigger negative thoughts that you can’t live up to expectations. Perhaps you can drop a class to retake it later or check your other responsibilities to see what you can delete or delegate for now.</p>
<p><strong>Practice deep breathing</strong> Deep breathing triggers the parasympathetic nervous system. It helps to lower your heart rate and blood pressure, forcing oxygen into the bloodstream via oxygenated cells.</p>
<p>When you feel depressed or can feel anger building, step away and inhale through your nose, filling your lungs to capacity. Hold for a few seconds, then slowly exhale through your mouth. Repeat as necessary until you feel calmer.</p>
<p><strong>Look to relaxation techniques</strong> Depression and anger respond well to relaxation techniques, as these trigger the calming parasympathetic nervous system. Try progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and releasing muscle groups.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="How to Manage Depression and Anger: 5 Practical Tips" class="alignleft wp-image-32138" height="200" src="https://orangecountychristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-to-manage-depression-and-anger-5-practical-tips-500x334.jpg" width="300" /></strong>This exercise allows you to feel the difference between a relaxed muscle and the tension you may be holding onto. After you have completed a round of exercises throughout the body, concentrate on any body parts that still feel tense.</p>
<p><strong>Journal thoughts and emotions</strong> Allowing thoughts and emotions to race through your head unchecked causes not only depression but also anxiety. A constructive way to slow down these thoughts is through journaling.</p>
<p>Find a nice pen and notebook and jot down your thoughts and feelings. Try to do this daily. After a while, you may be able to identify negative thought patterns. You can also share your journal entries with a counselor to help break the patterns and change behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Practice anger management</strong> The Bible tells us that we can be angry (it is a natural emotion), but not sin in anger. Seek help if you have trouble controlling your temper or lashing out at others. Learn to take a “time out” when you need to and practice daily affirmations.</p>
<p>You can manage depression and anger with Christian counseling, combining psychology with faith-based principles to treat your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.</p>
<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>Help for depression and anger is only a click or call away. Our office representatives would love to help connect you to a Christian counselor who will assess your symptoms and create a care plan with you.</p>
<p>You can manage depression and anger with evidence-based psychology and Christian principles. Contact us today to get started.</p>

<title>Forgiving Others: Why It’s Important to Our Health</title>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-4 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-3 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-4"><p>People struggle with the concept of forgiveness. The human question, “Why should I even bother to forgive?” is prevalent in our society, and it’s a difficult one. When Jesus told his disciples to forgive 70&#215;7 times, he was commanding them to go against their instinct to hold a grudge. It’s easier to stay angry than it is to forgive, but it’s not better for us.</p>
<h3>What happens when we forgive?</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we let go of the resentment or desire for revenge, even though the hurt may remain. Physically, our brain feels more empathy, compassion, and understanding. The amygdala, which processes our fear response, is downgraded, and the pain network in our brain is deactivated.</p>
<p>The pain network can be associated with grievances, and deactivating it lowers stress hormone levels, which contributes to overall physical health and builds resilience. The prefrontal cortex also engages, leading to better self-control and the ability to focus on positive future pursuits instead of dwelling on the pain from the past (Ricciardi et al., 2013).</p>
<h3>Why Forgiveness Matters</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we feel better, not because we are letting the person who hurt us off the hook, but because we are taking away their power to hurt us. We are not telling them that their actions or abuse are okay, because they are not. But we are letting go of vengeance and leaving it to God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others against their sins, your father will not forgive your sins.” – </em><strong>Matthew 6:14-15, ESV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Physically, not holding onto a grudge has positive effects as well. According to a study done by Johns Hopkins, when you release the anger and regulate emotions, it can lead to lower blood pressure, cortisol levels (which contribute to stubborn belly fat that won’t let go), and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Choosing to forgive can also lower cholesterol levels, improve sleep, and reduce physical pain.</p>
<h3>Historical Example</h3>
<p>Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch Christian woman who lived in the Netherlands during the Nazi Occupation. She helped children with special needs learn how to read and write and was outspoken about her faith. She lived with her father, Kasper, and her sister Elizabeth (Betsy).</p>
<p>When the laws discriminating against Jews were implemented, she and her family decided to take a stand. They built a fake wall up in her bedroom to hide Jewish citizens until they could get fake passports and smuggle them out of the country. She even had connections in the social services office to get more food ration tickets.</p>
<p>Their plan worked well for a while until a man by the name of Jan Vogel tricked her and turned the family over. They were able to hide the Jews and keep them safe, but the Ten Boom Family was arrested. Kasper died, and Corrie and Betsy were sent to Ravensbrück, where the conditions were deplorable. Their cabin had lice, which Betsy told Corrie to count as a blessing because the lice kept the guards from coming near.</p>
<p>They were forced to line up and work hard to the point where Betsy eventually passed away after the strenuous labor. Corrie held resentment for years until she came face-to-face with the man who betrayed her.</p>
<p>It was then that she said the Lord reminded her that if Jesus could forgive her for any of her sins, she could forgive the man who betrayed her. She reported finding freedom in that moment and traveled the world talking about the spiritual benefits of forgiveness (2023).</p>
<h3>The Cost of Unforgiveness</h3>
<p><a href="http://localshrink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jametlene-reskp-Cm8KUxo4ggw-unsplash.jpg"><img alt="forgiving others " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-51484" height="169" src="http://localshrink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jametlene-reskp-Cm8KUxo4ggw-unsplash-300x169.jpg" width="300" /></a>According to an article by Johns Hopkins, forgiveness can lead to many positive effects on the body. Studies have found that when a person refuses to remain bitter, they have a lower risk of heart attacks, better cholesterol levels, lower amounts of pain, better blood pressure, lower anxiety, depression, and stress.</p>
<p>When a person refuses to forgive, they willingly put themselves in chronic fight-or-flight mode, which spikes their cortisol, lowers their immune response, and can raise blood pressure and heart rate, which could eventually lead to a heart attack. A lack of forgiveness could also contribute to diabetes. Forgiveness, however, calms stress levels (2024).</p>
<h3>Forgiveness as a Process</h3>
<p>It is easy to tell somebody that they are forgiven, but sometimes the actions do not line up with their words, and that is because to forgive, a person needs to put down their pride and their hurt.</p>
<p>When Jesus told his disciples to forgive seventy times seven times, it was to demonstrate that the process of forgiveness is ongoing and does not just stop. People will disappoint us, and in each disappointment, we have a choice: let the disappointment take over and change the way we see the person or choose to forgive.</p>
<p>Forgiveness unfolds in stages: acknowledging the pain, grieving, and choosing release. And because people are inherently flawed, this is a process that needs to be repeated.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis, Joseph was raised well by his family. He was the first child that Rachel conceived when his parents thought conception was impossible. His father, Jacob, spoiled him, giving him everything, and that made his brothers jealous, so rather than showing compassion or understanding, they let their bitterness and jealousy overcome them and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>Joseph had favor in the eyes of God and was sold to a wealthy Egyptian named Potiphar. He worked his way up in Potiphar’s household and caught the attention of Potiphar’s wife. She tried to convince him to sleep with her, and when he refused, she accused him of rape, which resulted in Joseph being arrested and thrown in prison.</p>
<p>But God helped Joseph to interpret dreams for two other prisoners. One of the prisoners was set free and eventually remembered Joseph’s ability to interpret dreams at a time when Pharaoh was plagued with dreams. Joseph was sent for.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s God-given wisdom got him out of prison, and he became the second most powerful man in Egypt. He worked to prepare Egypt for a famine that was to come in seven years.</p>
<p>Seven years later, Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt to buy food. Though they did not recognize him, Joseph recognized them. He first tested them to see if they had truly changed, accusing them of theft, but eventually he revealed his identity and demonstrated forgiveness. He told them that God brought him there to preserve their lives and future generations. Then he brought his family to live with him in Egypt.</p>
<p>He recognized that all the pain they caused would be used for good. He told them that what they meant for evil God turned to good, as He does for all of those who love Him.</p>
<h3>Boundaries and Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Forgiveness does not mean that reconciliation needs to occur. When abuse is present, the safety of the abused is more important than the relationship. It is important to forgive while still maintaining boundaries, meaning that some tough questions may need to be asked, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long has this person been in my life?</li>
<li>What is my relationship with them?</li>
<li>Why do I feel obligated to have them in my life, or why should I cut them out?</li>
<li>How often have they hurt me? Is this a pattern? If so, can I let go?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may also determine that while they have forgiven the person who hurt them, they don’t feel comfortable seeing them frequently, or alone. Perhaps the hurt person decides that they only want to see them during family events, or in public outings to see if the perpetrator’s behaviors have changed (Kail, 2020).</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Forgiveness is a process with many benefits and zero harm in doing it. Forgiveness does not absolve the person of what they did but rather takes away the perpetrator’s ability to continuously and actively harm somebody. It is taking away the power to make the victim angry.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not always mean reconciliation, and in cases of abuse, reconciliation is not recommended unless the abuser goes through therapy and shows true life change. Even then, it is up to the discretion of the person who was abused.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a choice that every person must make every day. Sometimes it’s for trivial things like mean words, other times it’s for situations that cause damage to multiple people. Either way, forgiveness is needed, and sometimes we need forgiveness even more than we need to forgive.</p>

The human question, “Why should I even bother to forgive?” is prevalent in our society, and it’s a difficult one. When Jesus told his disciples to forgive 70&#215;7 times, he was commanding them to go against their instinct to hold a grudge. It’s easier to stay angry than it is to forgive, but it’s not better for us.</p>
<h3>What happens when we forgive?</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we let go of the resentment or desire for revenge, even though the hurt may remain. Physically, our brain feels more empathy, compassion, and understanding. The amygdala, which processes our fear response, is downgraded, and the pain network in our brain is deactivated.</p>
<p>The pain network can be associated with grievances, and deactivating it lowers stress hormone levels, which contributes to overall physical health and builds resilience. The prefrontal cortex also engages, leading to better self-control and the ability to focus on positive future pursuits instead of dwelling on the pain from the past (Ricciardi et al., 2013).</p>
<h3>Why Forgiveness Matters</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we feel better, not because we are letting the person who hurt us off the hook, but because we are taking away their power to hurt us. We are not telling them that their actions or abuse are okay, because they are not. But we are letting go of vengeance and leaving it to God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others against their sins, your father will not forgive your sins.” – </em><strong>Matthew 6:14-15, ESV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Physically, not holding onto a grudge has positive effects as well. According to a study done by Johns Hopkins, when you release the anger and regulate emotions, it can lead to lower blood pressure, cortisol levels (which contribute to stubborn belly fat that won’t let go), and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Choosing to forgive can also lower cholesterol levels, improve sleep, and reduce physical pain.</p>
<h3>Historical Example</h3>
<p>Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch Christian woman who lived in the Netherlands during the Nazi Occupation. She helped children with special needs learn how to read and write and was outspoken about her faith. She lived with her father, Kasper, and her sister Elizabeth (Betsy).</p>
<p>When the laws discriminating against Jews were implemented, she and her family decided to take a stand. They built a fake wall up in her bedroom to hide Jewish citizens until they could get fake passports and smuggle them out of the country. She even had connections in the social services office to get more food ration tickets.</p>
<p>Their plan worked well for a while until a man by the name of Jan Vogel tricked her and turned the family over. They were able to hide the Jews and keep them safe, but the Ten Boom Family was arrested. Kasper died, and Corrie and Betsy were sent to Ravensbrück, where the conditions were deplorable. Their cabin had lice, which Betsy told Corrie to count as a blessing because the lice kept the guards from coming near.</p>
<p>They were forced to line up and work hard to the point where Betsy eventually passed away after the strenuous labor. Corrie held resentment for years until she came face-to-face with the man who betrayed her.</p>
<p>It was then that she said the Lord reminded her that if Jesus could forgive her for any of her sins, she could forgive the man who betrayed her. She reported finding freedom in that moment and traveled the world talking about the spiritual benefits of forgiveness (2023).</p>
<h3>The Cost of Unforgiveness</h3>
<p>According to an article by Johns Hopkins, forgiveness can lead to many positive effects on the body. Studies have found that when a person refuses to remain bitter, they have a lower risk of heart attacks, better cholesterol levels, lower amounts of pain, better blood pressure, lower anxiety, depression, and stress.</p>
<p>When a person refuses to forgive, they willingly put themselves in chronic fight-or-flight mode, which spikes their cortisol, lowers their immune response, and can raise blood pressure and heart rate, which could eventually lead to a heart attack. A lack of forgiveness could also contribute to diabetes. Forgiveness, however, calms stress levels (2024).</p>
<h3>Forgiveness as a Process</h3>
<p>It is easy to tell somebody that they are forgiven, but sometimes the actions do not line up with their words, and that is because to forgive, a person needs to put down their pride and their hurt.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25942" height="169" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jametlene-reskp-Cm8KUxo4ggw-unsplash-300x169.jpg" width="300" />When Jesus told his disciples to forgive seventy times seven times, it was to demonstrate that the process of forgiveness is ongoing and does not just stop. People will disappoint us, and in each disappointment, we have a choice: let the disappointment take over and change the way we see the person or choose to forgive.</p>
<p>Forgiveness unfolds in stages: acknowledging the pain, grieving, and choosing release. And because people are inherently flawed, this is a process that needs to be repeated.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis, Joseph was raised well by his family. He was the first child that Rachel conceived when his parents thought conception was impossible. His father, Jacob, spoiled him, giving him everything, and that made his brothers jealous, so rather than showing compassion or understanding, they let their bitterness and jealousy overcome them and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>Joseph had favor in the eyes of God and was sold to a wealthy Egyptian named Potiphar. He worked his way up in Potiphar’s household and caught the attention of Potiphar’s wife. She tried to convince him to sleep with her, and when he refused, she accused him of rape, which resulted in Joseph being arrested and thrown in prison.</p>
<p>But God helped Joseph to interpret dreams for two other prisoners. One of the prisoners was set free and eventually remembered Joseph’s ability to interpret dreams at a time when Pharaoh was plagued with dreams. Joseph was sent for.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s God-given wisdom got him out of prison, and he became the second most powerful man in Egypt. He worked to prepare Egypt for a famine that was to come in seven years.</p>
<p>Seven years later, Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt to buy food. Though they did not recognize him, Joseph recognized them. He first tested them to see if they had truly changed, accusing them of theft, but eventually he revealed his identity and demonstrated forgiveness. He told them that God brought him there to preserve their lives and future generations. Then he brought his family to live with him in Egypt.</p>
<p>He recognized that all the pain they caused would be used for good. He told them that what they meant for evil God turned to good, as He does for all of those who love Him.</p>
<h3>Boundaries and Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Forgiveness does not mean that reconciliation needs to occur. When abuse is present, the safety of the abused is more important than the relationship. It is important to forgive while still maintaining boundaries, meaning that some tough questions may need to be asked, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long has this person been in my life?</li>
<li>What is my relationship with them?</li>
<li>Why do I feel obligated to have them in my life, or why should I cut them out?</li>
<li>How often have they hurt me? Is this a pattern? If so, can I let go?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may also determine that while they have forgiven the person who hurt them, they don’t feel comfortable seeing them frequently, or alone. Perhaps the hurt person decides that they only want to see them during family events, or in public outings to see if the perpetrator’s behaviors have changed (Kail, 2020).</p>

<p>In the book of Genesis, Joseph was raised well by his family. He was the first child that Rachel conceived when his parents thought conception was impossible. His father, Jacob, spoiled him, giving him everything, and that made his brothers jealous, so rather than showing compassion or understanding, they let their bitterness and jealousy overcome them and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>Joseph had favor in the eyes of God and was sold to a wealthy Egyptian named Potiphar. He worked his way up in Potiphar’s household and caught the attention of Potiphar’s wife. She tried to convince him to sleep with her, and when he refused, she accused him of rape, which resulted in Joseph being arrested and thrown in prison.</p>
<p>But God helped Joseph to interpret dreams for two other prisoners. One of the prisoners was set free and eventually remembered Joseph’s ability to interpret dreams at a time when Pharaoh was plagued with dreams. Joseph was sent for.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s God-given wisdom got him out of prison, and he became the second most powerful man in Egypt. He worked to prepare Egypt for a famine that was to come in seven years.</p>
<p>Seven years later, Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt to buy food. Though they did not recognize him, Joseph recognized them. He first tested them to see if they had truly changed, accusing them of theft, but eventually he revealed his identity and demonstrated forgiveness. He told them that God brought him there to preserve their lives and future generations. Then he brought his family to live with him in Egypt.</p>
<p>He recognized that all the pain they caused would be used for good. He told them that what they meant for evil God turned to good, as He does for all of those who love Him.</p>
<h3>Boundaries and Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Forgiveness does not mean that reconciliation needs to occur. When abuse is present, the safety of the abused is more important than the relationship. It is important to forgive while still maintaining boundaries, meaning that some tough questions may need to be asked, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long has this person been in my life?</li>
<li>What is my relationship with them?</li>
<li>Why do I feel obligated to have them in my life, or why should I cut them out?</li>
<li>How often have they hurt me? Is this a pattern? If so, can I let go?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may also determine that while they have forgiven the person who hurt them, they don’t feel comfortable seeing them frequently, or alone. Perhaps the hurt person decides that they only want to see them during family events, or in public outings to see if the perpetrator’s behaviors have changed (Kail, 2020).</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Forgiveness is a process with many benefits and zero harm in doing it. Forgiveness does not absolve the person of what they did but rather takes away the perpetrator’s ability to continuously and actively harm somebody. It is taking away the power to make the victim angry.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not always mean reconciliation, and in cases of abuse, reconciliation is not recommended unless the abuser goes through therapy and shows true life change. Even then, it is up to the discretion of the person who was abused.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a choice that every person must make every day. Sometimes it’s for trivial things like mean words, other times it’s for situations that cause damage to multiple people. Either way, forgiveness is needed, and sometimes we need forgiveness even more than we need to forgive.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>People struggle with the concept of forgiveness. The human question, “Why should I even bother to forgive?” is prevalent in our society, and it’s a difficult one. When Jesus told his disciples to forgive 70&#215;7 times, he was commanding them to go against their instinct to hold a grudge. It’s easier to stay angry than it is to forgive, but it’s not better for us.</p>
<h3>What happens when we forgive?</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we let go of the resentment or desire for revenge, even though the hurt may remain. Physically, our brain feels more empathy, compassion, and understanding. The amygdala, which processes our fear response, is downgraded, and the pain network in our brain is deactivated.</p>
<p>The pain network can be associated with grievances, and deactivating it lowers stress hormone levels, which contributes to overall physical health and builds resilience. The prefrontal cortex also engages, leading to better self-control and the ability to focus on positive future pursuits instead of dwelling on the pain from the past (Ricciardi et al., 2013).</p>
<h3>Why Forgiveness Matters</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we feel better, not because we are letting the person who hurt us off the hook, but because we are taking away their power to hurt us. We are not telling them that their actions or abuse are okay, because they are not. But we are letting go of vengeance and leaving it to God.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others against their sins, your father will not forgive your sins.” – </em><strong>Matthew 6:14-15, ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Physically, not holding onto a grudge has positive effects as well. According to a study done by Johns Hopkins, when you release the anger and regulate emotions, it can lead to lower blood pressure, cortisol levels (which contribute to stubborn belly fat that won’t let go), and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Choosing to forgive can also lower cholesterol levels, improve sleep, and reduce physical pain.</p>
<h3>Historical Example</h3>
<p>Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch Christian woman who lived in the Netherlands during the Nazi Occupation. She helped children with special needs learn how to read and write and was outspoken about her faith. She lived with her father, Kasper, and her sister Elizabeth (Betsy).</p>
<p>When the laws discriminating against Jews were implemented, she and her family decided to take a stand. They built a fake wall up in her bedroom to hide Jewish citizens until they could get fake passports and smuggle them out of the country. She even had connections in the social services office to get more food ration tickets.</p>
<p>Their plan worked well for a while until a man by the name of Jan Vogel tricked her and turned the family over. They were able to hide the Jews and keep them safe, but the Ten Boom Family was arrested. Kasper died, and Corrie and Betsy were sent to Ravensbrück, where the conditions were deplorable. Their cabin had lice, which Betsy told Corrie to count as a blessing because the lice kept the guards from coming near.</p>
<p>They were forced to line up and work hard to the point where Betsy eventually passed away after the strenuous labor. Corrie held resentment for years until she came face-to-face with the man who betrayed her.</p>
<p>It was then that she said the Lord reminded her that if Jesus could forgive her for any of her sins, she could forgive the man who betrayed her. She reported finding freedom in that moment and traveled the world talking about the spiritual benefits of forgiveness (2023).</p>
<h3>The Cost of Unforgiveness</h3>
<p>According to an article by Johns Hopkins, forgiveness can lead to many positive effects on the body. Studies have found that when a person refuses to remain bitter, they have a lower risk of heart attacks, better cholesterol levels, lower amounts of pain, better blood pressure, lower anxiety, depression, and stress.</p>
<img alt="Forgiving Others: Why It's Important to Our Health 1" class="alignleft wp-image-44186" height="169" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/forgiving-others-why-its-important-to-our-health-2-500x281.jpg" width="300" />When a person refuses to forgive, they willingly put themselves in chronic fight-or-flight mode, which spikes their cortisol, lowers their immune response, and can raise blood pressure and heart rate, which could eventually lead to a heart attack. A lack of forgiveness could also contribute to diabetes. Forgiveness, however, calms stress levels (2024).</p>
<h3>Forgiveness as a Process</h3>
<p>It is easy to tell somebody that they are forgiven, but sometimes the actions do not line up with their words, and that is because to forgive, a person needs to put down their pride and their hurt.</p>
<p>When Jesus told his disciples to forgive seventy times seven times, it was to demonstrate that the process of forgiveness is ongoing and does not just stop. People will disappoint us, and in each disappointment, we have a choice: let the disappointment take over and change the way we see the person or choose to forgive.</p>
<p>Forgiveness unfolds in stages: acknowledging the pain, grieving, and choosing release. And because people are inherently flawed, this is a process that needs to be repeated.</p>

<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/forgiving-others-why-its-important-to-our-health.jpg"><img alt="forgiving others " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-51484" height="169" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/forgiving-others-why-its-important-to-our-health.jpg" width="300" /></a>When a person refuses to forgive, they willingly put themselves in chronic fight-or-flight mode, which spikes their cortisol, lowers their immune response, and can raise blood pressure and heart rate, which could eventually lead to a heart attack. A lack of forgiveness could also contribute to diabetes. Forgiveness, however, calms stress levels (2024).</p>
<h3>Forgiveness as a Process</h3>
<p>It is easy to tell somebody that they are forgiven, but sometimes the actions do not line up with their words, and that is because to forgive, a person needs to put down their pride and their hurt.</p>
<p>When Jesus told his disciples to forgive seventy times seven times, it was to demonstrate that the process of forgiveness is ongoing and does not just stop. People will disappoint us, and in each disappointment, we have a choice: let the disappointment take over and change the way we see the person or choose to forgive.</p>
<p>Forgiveness unfolds in stages: acknowledging the pain, grieving, and choosing release. And because people are inherently flawed, this is a process that needs to be repeated.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis, Joseph was raised well by his family. He was the first child that Rachel conceived when his parents thought conception was impossible. His father, Jacob, spoiled him, giving him everything, and that made his brothers jealous, so rather than showing compassion or understanding, they let their bitterness and jealousy overcome them and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>Joseph had favor in the eyes of God and was sold to a wealthy Egyptian named Potiphar. He worked his way up in Potiphar’s household and caught the attention of Potiphar’s wife. She tried to convince him to sleep with her, and when he refused, she accused him of rape, which resulted in Joseph being arrested and thrown in prison.</p>
<p>But God helped Joseph to interpret dreams for two other prisoners. One of the prisoners was set free and eventually remembered Joseph’s ability to interpret dreams at a time when Pharaoh was plagued with dreams. Joseph was sent for.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s God-given wisdom got him out of prison, and he became the second most powerful man in Egypt. He worked to prepare Egypt for a famine that was to come in seven years.</p>
<p>Seven years later, Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt to buy food. Though they did not recognize him, Joseph recognized them. He first tested them to see if they had truly changed, accusing them of theft, but eventually he revealed his identity and demonstrated forgiveness. He told them that God brought him there to preserve their lives and future generations. Then he brought his family to live with him in Egypt.</p>
<p>He recognized that all the pain they caused would be used for good. He told them that what they meant for evil God turned to good, as He does for all of those who love Him.</p>
<h3>Boundaries and Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Forgiveness does not mean that reconciliation needs to occur. When abuse is present, the safety of the abused is more important than the relationship. It is important to forgive while still maintaining boundaries, meaning that some tough questions may need to be asked, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long has this person been in my life?</li>
<li>What is my relationship with them?</li>
<li>Why do I feel obligated to have them in my life, or why should I cut them out?</li>
<li>How often have they hurt me? Is this a pattern? If so, can I let go?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may also determine that while they have forgiven the person who hurt them, they don’t feel comfortable seeing them frequently, or alone. Perhaps the hurt person decides that they only want to see them during family events, or in public outings to see if the perpetrator’s behaviors have changed (Kail, 2020).</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Forgiveness is a process with many benefits and zero harm in doing it. Forgiveness does not absolve the person of what they did but rather takes away the perpetrator’s ability to continuously and actively harm somebody. It is taking away the power to make the victim angry.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not always mean reconciliation, and in cases of abuse, reconciliation is not recommended unless the abuser goes through therapy and shows true life change. Even then, it is up to the discretion of the person who was abused.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a choice that every person must make every day. Sometimes it’s for trivial things like mean words, other times it’s for situations that cause damage to multiple people. Either way, forgiveness is needed, and sometimes we need forgiveness even more than we need to forgive.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” – </em><strong>Luke 23:34, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-2 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-1 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-2"><p>Compulsive eating is an issue for many people. It is a coping mechanism that can be difficult to stop, mainly because we may not realize why we eat when we feel an urge, even when not hungry. The urge is consuming, and our emotions dictate when and how much we eat instead of physical hunger.</p>
<p>While overcoming compulsive eating may seem insurmountable, it is indeed possible. It’s not just about willpower but about fostering a new mindset more attuned to your body’s actual hunger signals and less influenced by emotional triggers.</p>
<p>This shift in perspective can be a potent tool in your journey to conquer compulsive eating. As you lean more into your faith and allow it to guide you in reconnecting to your body’s signals, you will find yourself on a path to recovery.</p>
<h3>The Habit Factor and How to Stop Compulsive Eating</h3>
<p>Compulsive eating comes down to thoughts, emotions, and actions that create habits. For example, while stressed at work, we have the urge to eat the candy in the dish in the break room. We know we are not hungry, but the urge is strong, and we give in. We have temporary relief from the stress. But then the anxiety, guilt, and shame return. We might even feel physically ill.</p>
<p>If we reverse engineer the routine, we might discover that this habit begins with a thought before we recognize an emotion. Our brains also recognize this habit, and knowing it brings us temporary relief, it engrains the habit so that it can reward us with an increase in chemicals that will make us feel better.</p>
<p>The key is to analyze the thoughts and emotions before you take a bite and learn to reframe these into positive and healthy thoughts. Next, behavioral change ensures that we are less likely to eat based on emotions.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to take to tackle compulsive eating.</p>
<p><strong>Identify the triggers</strong></p>
<p>You may not be able to avoid your compulsive eating triggers totally, but if you know what they are, you may be able to take action. For example, if your commute triggers you to drive through the nearest fast-food place on the way home, consider taking a different route home or packing a protein-rich snack and water for when the urge hits.</p>
<p><strong>Realize there is an underlying emotion</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6317" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/annie-spratt-lU9h4ZI-3YA-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The urge to eat is based on an emotion that more than likely makes you feel uncomfortable. Perhaps you are worried, anxious, afraid, angry, or sad. Identify the underlying emotion and analyze why you feel this way.</p>
<p>How can you tackle this head-on instead of eating? Do you need to express your feelings to someone else instead of hiding behind them? Do you need to complete a task, and is the procrastination making you anxious or fearful? Keep asking yourself <em>why</em> you feel this emotion until you can clearly sum it up.</p>
<p><strong>Define the thoughts</strong></p>
<p>A thought precedes an emotion, but those can be trickier to navigate. You may be so used to the thoughts that you miss the ones causing you to feel out of sorts. God gave us emotions, even the uncomfortable ones. They are there to signal that we may need to see what is really going on. Define the negative thoughts by journaling when you have the urge to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare for a different action</strong></p>
<p>You know that you are triggered to eat when you experience a specific emotion. Consider working with a counselor to compile a list of strategies. Taking different actions will lead to different results. This will take practice, and you will mess up occasionally (probably more initially), but you can do it. To start your list, consider doing something that will keep your mind and hands busy, such as cleaning, washing dishes, gardening, or knitting.</p>
<h3>Change your mindset with Christian counseling in Vancouver, Washington</h3>
<p>Our thoughts are not always truthful; these untruths can become beliefs when we repeat words for months or years. Changing your internal dialogue takes practice. You may not believe every positive statement you have to combat the negative thoughts because they do not feel true yet.</p>
<p>A Christian counselor in Vancouver, Washington can help you start with neutral statements until you feel ready to believe the positive ones. For example, you may think, “I’m stressed now and feel helpless. I’m never good enough.” The truth you could use to combat this might be, “I am enough because God says I am, and He created me.”</p>
<p>However, after years of negative thinking, you might not be able to honestly believe that you are good enough. Your counselor in Vancouver might suggest a neutral statement initially, such as, “I am learning that God made me in His image, and I am working on accepting that I am enough the way I am right now. I’m a work in progress.”</p>
<p>The Christian counselors in Vancouver, Washington are equipped with proven psychological techniques using Bible-based principles to help clients overcome compulsive eating. Contact our office today at Vancouver Christian Counseling in Washington to schedule a session.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-3 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-2 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-3"><p>Abandonment anxiety is an informal term used to describe a strong fear of losing a loved one or being rejected or deserted by the people you care about. It is not a medical diagnosis.</p>
<h3>Signs Of Abandonment Anxiety</h3>
<p>Abandonment anxiety can manifest in many different ways. These signs can vary in intensity and frequency. Some possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>fear of intimacy and getting close to people</li>
<li>feeling insecure in your relationships</li>
<li>finding it hard to trust others</li>
<li>needing frequent reassurance that you are liked or loved</li>
<li>hypersensitivity to criticism or perceived rejection</li>
<li>persistent fear that your friends or partners will abandon or reject you</li>
<li>overanalyzing everything and constantly looking for signs that the significant others in your life do not really like you</li>
<li>seeing problems where none exist</li>
<li>difficulty expressing your needs for fear that it will drive others away</li>
<li>lack of boundaries</li>
<li>giving too much, and always trying to please others, even at your own expense</li>
<li>being clingy or manipulative, or pushing others away to avoid having them leave you first</li>
<li>low self-esteem</li>
<li>feelings of unworthiness</li>
<li>staying in an unhealthy relationship because you are afraid of being alone</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes Of Abandonment Anxiety</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6308" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pexels-elisabethfossum-249097-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Abandonment anxiety can result from several factors, such as early childhood trauma, or being neglected, rejected, or left alone for extended periods of time by your primary caregiver. It can also be triggered in later life by experiences such as an unexpected breakup, being betrayed by someone you trust, the death of a loved one, an anxious attachment style, or a mental health condition such as borderline personality disorder.</p>
<h3>Impact of Abandonment Anxiety</h3>
<p>Abandonment anxiety can have a negative impact on your self-esteem, emotional stability, and sense of self-worth; be a source of significant stress; cause you to feel disconnected from others; and make it difficult for you to form and maintain meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>Some people react to abandonment anxiety by being clingy and in constant need of reassurance of their partner’s love and commitment. This can have a smothering effect, strain the relationship, and become a self-fulfilling prophecy, causing the rejection they fear. Others may do just the opposite. They may behave in self-sabotaging ways that push people away before they have a chance to get close and wind up hurting you.</p>
<h3>Coping with Abandonment Anxiety</h3>
<p><strong>Acknowledge your feelings</strong> Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. Acknowledge them without judging them and reflect on how accurate or rational they are by asking yourself if they can be substantiated.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6309" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pexels-miami302-29578696-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Learn the difference between feelings and facts</strong> Learn how to discern the difference between feelings and facts, and challenge your anxious thoughts and limiting beliefs instead of expecting the worst and reading meaning into things that aren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>Treat yourself kindly</strong> Treat yourself kindly and with compassion, and replace negative thoughts that devalue your self-worth with more positive, realistic ones. Focus on how much God loves you. Regularly remind yourself that your sense of self-worth is based on your identity as His beloved child rather than on the affirmation or rejection of others.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritize self-care</strong> Prioritize self-care and taking care of your basic needs instead of hyper-focusing on those of everyone else while neglecting your own.</p>
<p><strong>Journal</strong> Journaling has many benefits. It can help you express your feelings, see them from a more objective perspective, and identify patterns of behavior. You can then better understand what triggers them. Including positive things, such as small victories in journaling, can help increase your self-esteem and reinforce your sense of self-worth.</p>
<p><strong>Practice gratitude</strong> Practice looking for things you can be thankful for and journal about them as well. Doing this regularly can help shift your focus from negative “what ifs” to the positive things in your life. This can reduce your anxiety by training your brain to recognize the good.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to ground yourself in the now</strong> Learn to ground yourself in the present moment by practicing relaxation and mindfulness exercises. This can prepare you to stay anchored in stressful situations and observe difficult feelings from a state of calm awareness rather than being overwhelmed by them or overreacting.</p>
<p><strong>Consider counseling</strong> Counseling can serve as a valuable navigation tool. A trained mental health professional can help you identify and modify dysfunctional thought patterns and beliefs that are fueling your abandonment anxiety, as well as equip you with effective coping techniques.</p>
<h3>Bible Verses That Address Abandonment Anxiety</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6310" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pexels-jonathanborba-2917357-200x300.jpg" width="200" />God’s Word contains many verses that speak of His steadfast presence and love. The Bible is full of assurance that He will never reject you or forsake you. Look for verses that speak to your heart, underline them, and write them out.</p>
<p>You can also place them in strategic places, such as your bathroom mirror or refrigerator door. They can serve as constant reminders each time you see them that even if others abandon you, you can be sure that God never will. He loves you unconditionally, and nothing can separate you from His love.</p>
<p>The following are a few examples to get you started. Memorize them and speak them over yourself until they become internalized and firmly embedded in your heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.” </em><strong>– Hebrews 13:5b, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? </em><strong>– Psalm 118:6, ESV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me. </em><strong>– Psalm 27:10, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </em><strong>– Romans 8:39, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. </em><strong>– Isaiah 41:10, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cast all your anxiety on him</em> <em>because he cares for you.</em><strong> – 1 Peter 5:7, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul. </em><strong>– Psalm 94:19, ESV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure. </em><strong>&#8212; 2 Samuel 22:33, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight. </em><strong>– Proverbs 3:5-6, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Benefits of Counseling for Abandonment Anxiety</h3>
<p>Counseling provides a safe, nonjudgmental space in which you can explore what is at the core of your abandonment anxiety and how it is impacting your life. With the guidance and support of a trained mental health professional who will help you identify your triggers, you can begin to understand why you react the way you do and be able to see things from a broader, more positive, and realistic perspective.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6313" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/man-and-woman-near-grass-field-1415131-scaled-2-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The exact process may vary according to your unique symptoms and circumstances. It typically involves helping you recognize specific thought patterns and limiting beliefs that are perpetuating your abandonment anxiety. Then you can learn to challenge and reframe them. Your counselor can help equip you with effective coping mechanisms and strategies.</p>
<p>You can learn to set boundaries and enhance your communication skills. This will enable you to manage your emotions in healthier, more adaptive ways and build more secure, fulfilling relationships.</p>

<title>When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment</title>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-5 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-4 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-5"><p>Many people think Christians never get angry, or if they become angry, they shouldn’t stay angry. Anger is a strong response to something displeasing. Jesus says, “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33), meaning there will be struggles during our life’s path.</p>
<p>God also says that vengeance belongs to Him (Romans 12:19). God takes on the actionable part of anger because He knows the spiritual, emotional, and physical costs associated with anger. Responses vary depending on the situation and the person, but it’s natural to have some type of response when you feel you’ve been dealt an injustice.</p>
<p>Your anger response lets others know that you’re angry and to what degree, especially if they know you well. And though these responses must manifest respectfully to avoid violence and toxic behavior, communicating your feelings to whom the anger is directed can bring some relief, open communication, and possibly be a step toward resolution.</p>
<p>But what happens when the person you’re angry at isn’t there to talk to? What if the person you want to hang up on never calls? What if the person you want to yell at is in the grave? What if all this anger is pent up inside of you with no hope of release?</p>
<h3>Should Christians get angry?</h3>
<p>There is a widely accepted belief that Christians should not get angry. Those who hold this view often quote the Bible’s teachings about being slow to anger, being peacemakers, and being long-suffering. It’s unlikely that any Christian would counter that argument. But we aren’t robots either. We were created with feelings.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks quite a bit about anger, but it doesn’t say that we shouldn’t feel it. Feeling angry is a natural human emotion. Even Christ Himself felt righteous anger at the moneychangers in the temple. He overturned their tables in His wrath. The Bible doesn’t condemn anger as an emotion, but gives us guidelines about how to handle it.</p>
<p>“In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.” (Ephesians 4:26-27, NIV). This means that we will feel anger, but it’s what we do with that anger that matters.</p>
<h3>How should Christians respond?</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21535" height="300" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/miriam-g-LAt6qTonZ4A-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />If it’s inevitable, even condoned, that you will feel anger, how should you respond? The Bible tells us to be slow to speak and slow to anger (James 1:19, NIV). All of our reactive responses, like slammed doors and yelling, might not align with God’s Word. If we feel anger welling up inside, it is best to take control of that feeling, examine the true source of the anger, and then respond with godly action.</p>
<p>Godly action means turning your anger over to God. You use prayer and Scripture to guide you to a resolution. Is this a righteous anger, selfish, or sin-based? Ask yourself if you are being motivated by justice and a love for God, as Jesus was in the temple, or are you angry out of selfish motives? Whatever the motivation driving your anger, as a Christian, you need to be quick to forgive and speak your truth gently to avoid stirring up more anger. (Proverbs 15:1)</p>
<p>Being a Christian doesn’t make you a pushover; it gives you guidelines toward a righteous and godly resolution. That often comes in the form of a difficult conversation or establishing boundaries. You might have to tell someone how they’ve hurt you or insist on a set of rules to protect your peace.</p>
<h3>But what if you can’t talk it out?</h3>
<p>If you’re holding anger toward someone who has blocked you, ghosted you, moved, put a restraining order on you, or has died, you might wonder if the feelings inside of you will ever be satisfied. You might long to have a conversation with them, detailing how they mistreated you or explaining how you feel misunderstood.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21534" height="300" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/miriam-g-p6U8RVf0Mgs-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />But if they aren’t available to receive this information or to interact, you might be left with a tightly wound ball of anger and frustration. In counseling, there’s a technique called the empty chair technique. This technique allows an individual to identify and vocalize difficult emotions such as anger.</p>
<p>An individual speaks to an empty chair, visualizing that there is an individual actually occupying the chair. This technique provides a safe space for emotional expression, insight, and awareness. It can begin to allow greater space for healing and self-discovery.</p>
<p>While you might not be able to spill your heart or explain your feelings to a loved one who has passed away or justify your actions to an ex who has you blocked, you can still get that anger out in a productive way.</p>
<p>If you take the time to carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly pour your emotions out, your brain will have nearly the same benefit as it would if you were having the conversation with the person you’re angry with. This can bring the peace you are looking for. Here are some additional ways you can release the anger you hold inside.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21533" height="300" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/galina-kondratenko-ltJA0n3NUY4-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" /></strong>Prayer is a wonderful way to get that anger out of your heart and head and into the hands of God. Sometimes people think of prayer simply as a laundry list of wants or a formality, but prayer really is a conversation. If you’re feeling angry about something, tell God. Tell God your side of the story, ask for His intervention and peace, and dive into Scripture for further direction. As you’re praying, begin to visualize how you want your life to look when you’re feeling less angry.</p>
<p>Releasing your pent-up thoughts and describing the injustices that have been dealt to you is healing. And what better audience than your loving Heavenly Father, who just so happens to hold the power of the universe in His hands.</p>
<p><strong>Journaling</strong></p>
<p>If you have never tried journaling, you might be surprised at the benefits. If you’re angry at someone you don’t have access to, write it down. Spend as much time as you need, weeks, months even, to lay each feeling down on paper. Recall the incident that made you feel uncomfortable, unheard, or misunderstood. Tell your side of the story.</p>
<p>Journaling forces you to organize your thoughts and slows down your brain processing long enough to find reason and clarity. Write a letter, even if you never send it. Telling your story can sometimes be enough to satisfy your anger, even if no one else will ever hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong></p>
<p>While nothing can replace God’s intervention and peaceful presence, therapy can help you with unresolved anger. Through roleplay and learning about other emotions underneath anger, you can explain your perspective, communicate your anger, and untangle the intricacies of your relationships and situations</p>
<p>A Christian therapist can identify Scriptures and share biblical truths that apply directly to your circumstances. This process will not only give you the satisfaction of being heard but will also provide you with an ally who can share coping skills to get you on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>While you might never get the apology you’re looking for or have the opportunity to explain your side of the story, you can still forgive. Not by your own limited human abilities but through the never-ending, abundant grace of God. Even if you don’t want to forgive, you can still apply the blood of Jesus to your anger and leave it in His trustworthy hands. Soon, your heart will soften, and peace will grow where anger once lived.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-5 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-4 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-5"><p>Many people think Christians never get angry, or if they become angry, they shouldn’t stay angry. Anger is a strong response to something displeasing. Jesus says, “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33), meaning there will be struggles during our life’s path.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21555" height="300" src="https://millcreekchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/miriam-g-LAt6qTonZ4A-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />God also says that vengeance belongs to Him (Romans 12:19). God takes on the actionable part of anger because He knows the spiritual, emotional, and physical costs associated with anger. Responses vary depending on the situation and the person, but it’s natural to have some type of response when you feel you’ve been dealt an injustice.</p>
<p>Your anger response lets others know that you’re angry and to what degree, especially if they know you well. And though these responses must manifest respectfully to avoid violence and toxic behavior, communicating your feelings to whom the anger is directed can bring some relief, open communication, and possibly be a step toward resolution.</p>
<p>But what happens when the person you’re angry at isn’t there to talk to? What if the person you want to hang up on never calls? What if the person you want to yell at is in the grave? What if all this anger is pent up inside of you with no hope of release?</p>
<h3>Should Christians get angry?</h3>
<p>There is a widely accepted belief that Christians should not get angry. Those who hold this view often quote the Bible’s teachings about being slow to anger, being peacemakers, and being long-suffering. It’s unlikely that any Christian would counter that argument. But we aren’t robots either. We were created with feelings.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks quite a bit about anger, but it doesn’t say that we shouldn’t feel it. Feeling angry is a natural human emotion. Even Christ Himself felt righteous anger at the moneychangers in the temple. He overturned their tables in His wrath. The Bible doesn’t condemn anger as an emotion, but gives us guidelines about how to handle it.</p>
<p>“In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.” (Ephesians 4:26-27, NIV). This means that we will feel anger, but it’s what we do with that anger that matters.</p>
<h3>How should Christians respond?</h3>
<p>If it’s inevitable, even condoned, that you will feel anger, how should you respond? The Bible tells us to be slow to speak and slow to anger (James 1:19, NIV). All of our reactive responses, like slammed doors and yelling, might not align with God’s Word. If we feel anger welling up inside, it is best to take control of that feeling, examine the true source of the anger, and then respond with godly action.</p>
<p>Godly action means turning your anger over to God. You use prayer and Scripture to guide you to a resolution. Is this a righteous anger, selfish, or sin-based? Ask yourself if you are being motivated by justice and a love for God, as Jesus was in the temple, or are you angry out of selfish motives? Whatever the motivation driving your anger, as a Christian, you need to be quick to forgive and speak your truth gently to avoid stirring up more anger. (Proverbs 15:1)</p>
<p>Being a Christian doesn’t make you a pushover; it gives you guidelines toward a righteous and godly resolution. That often comes in the form of a difficult conversation or establishing boundaries. You might have to tell someone how they’ve hurt you or insist on a set of rules to protect your peace.</p>
<h3>But what if you can’t talk it out?</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21553" height="300" src="https://millcreekchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/miriam-g-p6U8RVf0Mgs-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />If you’re holding anger toward someone who has blocked you, ghosted you, moved, put a restraining order on you, or has died, you might wonder if the feelings inside of you will ever be satisfied. You might long to have a conversation with them, detailing how they mistreated you or explaining how you feel misunderstood.</p>
<p>But if they aren’t available to receive this information or to interact, you might be left with a tightly wound ball of anger and frustration. In counseling, there’s a technique called the empty chair technique. This technique allows an individual to identify and vocalize difficult emotions such as anger.</p>
<p>An individual speaks to an empty chair, visualizing that there is an individual actually occupying the chair. This technique provides a safe space for emotional expression, insight, and awareness. It can begin to allow greater space for healing and self-discovery.</p>
<p>While you might not be able to spill your heart or explain your feelings to a loved one who has passed away or justify your actions to an ex who has you blocked, you can still get that anger out in a productive way.</p>

<p>While you might not be able to spill your heart or explain your feelings to a loved one who has passed away or justify your actions to an ex who has you blocked, you can still get that anger out in a productive way.</p>
<p>If you take the time to carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly pour your emotions out, your brain will have nearly the same benefit as it would if you were having the conversation with the person you’re angry with. This can bring the peace you are looking for. Here are some additional ways you can release the anger you hold inside.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment 3" class="alignleft wp-image-35923" height="300" src="https://redmondchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-4-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Prayer</strong>
<p>Prayer is a wonderful way to get that anger out of your heart and head and into the hands of God. Sometimes people think of prayer simply as a laundry list of wants or a formality, but prayer really is a conversation. If you’re feeling angry about something, tell God. Tell God your side of the story, ask for His intervention and peace, and dive into Scripture for further direction. As you’re praying, begin to visualize how you want your life to look when you’re feeling less angry.</p>
<p>Releasing your pent-up thoughts and describing the injustices that have been dealt to you is healing. And what better audience than your loving Heavenly Father, who just so happens to hold the power of the universe in His hands.</p>
<p><strong>Journaling</strong></p>
<p>If you have never tried journaling, you might be surprised at the benefits. If you’re angry at someone you don’t have access to, write it down. Spend as much time as you need, weeks, months even, to lay each feeling down on paper. Recall the incident that made you feel uncomfortable, unheard, or misunderstood. Tell your side of the story.</p>
<p>Journaling forces you to organize your thoughts and slows down your brain processing long enough to find reason and clarity. Write a letter, even if you never send it. Telling your story can sometimes be enough to satisfy your anger, even if no one else will ever hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong></p>
<p>While nothing can replace God’s intervention and peaceful presence, therapy can help you with unresolved anger. Through roleplay and learning about other emotions underneath anger, you can explain your perspective, communicate your anger, and untangle the intricacies of your relationships and situations</p>
<p>A Christian therapist can identify Scriptures and share biblical truths that apply directly to your circumstances. This process will not only give you the satisfaction of being heard but will also provide you with an ally who can share coping skills to get you on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>While you might never get the apology you’re looking for or have the opportunity to explain your side of the story, you can still forgive. Not by your own limited human abilities but through the never-ending, abundant grace of God. Even if you don’t want to forgive, you can still apply the blood of Jesus to your anger and leave it in His trustworthy hands. Soon, your heart will soften, and peace will grow where anger once lived.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Many people think Christians never get angry, or if they become angry, they shouldn’t stay angry. Anger is a strong response to something displeasing. Jesus says, “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33), meaning there will be struggles during our life’s path.</p>
<img alt="When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment 1" class="alignleft wp-image-44157" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-2-333x500.jpg" width="200" />God also says that vengeance belongs to Him (Romans 12:19). God takes on the actionable part of anger because He knows the spiritual, emotional, and physical costs associated with anger. Responses vary depending on the situation and the person, but it’s natural to have some type of response when you feel you’ve been dealt an injustice.</p>
<p>Your anger response lets others know that you’re angry and to what degree, especially if they know you well. And though these responses must manifest respectfully to avoid violence and toxic behavior, communicating your feelings to whom the anger is directed can bring some relief, open communication, and possibly be a step toward resolution.</p>
<p>But what happens when the person you’re angry at isn’t there to talk to? What if the person you want to hang up on never calls? What if the person you want to yell at is in the grave? What if all this anger is pent up inside of you with no hope of release?</p>
<h3>Should Christians get angry?</h3>
<p>There is a widely accepted belief that Christians should not get angry. Those who hold this view often quote the Bible’s teachings about being slow to anger, being peacemakers, and being long-suffering. It’s unlikely that any Christian would counter that argument. But we aren’t robots either. We were created with feelings.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks quite a bit about anger, but it doesn’t say that we shouldn’t feel it. Feeling angry is a natural human emotion. Even Christ Himself felt righteous anger at the moneychangers in the temple. He overturned their tables in His wrath. The Bible doesn’t condemn anger as an emotion, but gives us guidelines about how to handle it.</p>
<p>“In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.” (Ephesians 4:26-27, NIV). This means that we will feel anger, but it’s what we do with that anger that matters.</p>
<h3>How should Christians respond?</h3>
<p>If it’s inevitable, even condoned, that you will feel anger, how should you respond? The Bible tells us to be slow to speak and slow to anger (James 1:19, NIV). All of our reactive responses, like slammed doors and yelling, might not align with God’s Word. If we feel anger welling up inside, it is best to take control of that feeling, examine the true source of the anger, and then respond with godly action.</p>
<p><img alt="When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment 2" class="alignright wp-image-44158" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-3-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Godly action means turning your anger over to God. You use prayer and Scripture to guide you to a resolution. Is this a righteous anger, selfish, or sin-based? Ask yourself if you are being motivated by justice and a love for God, as Jesus was in the temple, or are you angry out of selfish motives? Whatever the motivation driving your anger, as a Christian, you need to be quick to forgive and speak your truth gently to avoid stirring up more anger. (Proverbs 15:1)</p>
<p>Being a Christian doesn’t make you a pushover; it gives you guidelines toward a righteous and godly resolution. That often comes in the form of a difficult conversation or establishing boundaries. You might have to tell someone how they’ve hurt you or insist on a set of rules to protect your peace.</p>
<h3>But what if you can’t talk it out?</h3>
<p>If you’re holding anger toward someone who has blocked you, ghosted you, moved, put a restraining order on you, or has died, you might wonder if the feelings inside of you will ever be satisfied. You might long to have a conversation with them, detailing how they mistreated you or explaining how you feel misunderstood.</p>
<p>But if they aren’t available to receive this information or to interact, you might be left with a tightly wound ball of anger and frustration. In counseling, there’s a technique called the empty chair technique. This technique allows an individual to identify and vocalize difficult emotions such as anger.</p>

<p>While you might not be able to spill your heart or explain your feelings to a loved one who has passed away or justify your actions to an ex who has you blocked, you can still get that anger out in a productive way.</p>
<p>If you take the time to carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly pour your emotions out, your brain will have nearly the same benefit as it would if you were having the conversation with the person you’re angry with. This can bring the peace you are looking for. Here are some additional ways you can release the anger you hold inside.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong></p>
<p>Prayer is a wonderful way to get that anger out of your heart and head and into the hands of God. Sometimes people think of prayer simply as a laundry list of wants or a formality, but prayer really is a conversation. If you’re feeling angry about something, tell God. Tell God your side of the story, ask for His intervention and peace, and dive into Scripture for further direction. As you’re praying, begin to visualize how you want your life to look when you’re feeling less angry.</p>
<p>Releasing your pent-up thoughts and describing the injustices that have been dealt to you is healing. And what better audience than your loving Heavenly Father, who just so happens to hold the power of the universe in His hands.</p>

<p>If you have never tried journaling, you might be surprised at the benefits. If you’re angry at someone you don’t have access to, write it down. Spend as much time as you need, weeks, months even, to lay each feeling down on paper. Recall the incident that made you feel uncomfortable, unheard, or misunderstood. Tell your side of the story.</p>
<p>Journaling forces you to organize your thoughts and slows down your brain processing long enough to find reason and clarity. Write a letter, even if you never send it. Telling your story can sometimes be enough to satisfy your anger, even if no one else will ever hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong></p>
<p>While nothing can replace God’s intervention and peaceful presence, therapy can help you with unresolved anger. Through roleplay and learning about other emotions underneath anger, you can explain your perspective, communicate your anger, and untangle the intricacies of your relationships and situations</p>
<p>A Christian therapist can identify Scriptures and share biblical truths that apply directly to your circumstances. This process will not only give you the satisfaction of being heard but will also provide you with an ally who can share coping skills to get you on the road to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Forgiveness</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-4.jpg"><img alt="Christian Counseling " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-85926" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-4.jpg" width="300" /></a>While you might never get the apology you’re looking for or have the opportunity to explain your side of the story, you can still forgive. Not by your own limited human abilities but through the never-ending, abundant grace of God. Even if you don’t want to forgive, you can still apply the blood of Jesus to your anger and leave it in His trustworthy hands. Soon, your heart will soften, and peace will grow where anger once lived.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, the popularity of EMDR treatment has increased significantly, yet many remain unsure of how it works. Simply put, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of guided psychotherapy that aims to help a person’s brain process trauma. It is an effective form of therapy grounded in science and evidence and is recognized by the World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association.</p>
<p>What makes EMDR treatment unlike talk therapy is the use of bilateral stimulation. In a session, the therapist will ask the patient to begin to talk about the events that have caused them distress. While they speak, they are instructed to focus on the therapist’s hand, an object, a sound, or a series of light taps, which alternate back and forth, from left to right.</p>
<p>As they speak, their eyes move back and forth following the therapist’s instructions. This motion prompts the brain’s natural healing process to take place. Being skeptical of such an unusual method is understandable, but learning the science of EMDR treatment is a good place to start.</p>
<h3>A Brief History Of EMDR</h3>
<p>EMDR treatment began with psychologist Francine Shapiro in 1987. Whilst out for a walk in the park one day, she began to realize that as her eyes moved rapidly from one point of stimulation to another, the intensity of her emotions and thoughts was calmed. This experience led her to conduct therapy-based experiments on herself and a control group, leading to surprisingly positive results.</p>
<p>By 1991, she had developed a detailed prototype of EMDR treatment, which she began teaching to licensed therapists and clinicians. There have since been over thirty controlled outcome studies of EMDR treatment, each showing the effectiveness of the cognitive-based therapy.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to know the history of a popular form of therapy, and it’s still natural to have questions. More than any other form of psychotherapy, EMDR treatment is possibly the most confusing to hear about and understand from an outside perspective. Let’s break it down to the core essentials of how EMDR works.</p>
<h3>It starts with memories</h3>
<p>Everything we experience, both good and bad, helpful and harmful, is stored in our brain as a memory. These memories are like files on a computer that can be opened, viewed, and closed again, without any issues. They sometimes show that trauma occurred, and serve as a reminder of the experience, but just like scars that remain after an injury, they do not continue to cause pain or distress. Memories like this are known as adaptive memories.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it.jpg"><img alt="emdr treatment " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-48819" height="169" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it.jpg" width="300" /></a>For example, you might have an unexpectedly heated interaction with a stranger online that results in them calling you names and making threats to your safety. Though you don’t know this person and will likely report and block them, you are understandably upset and distressed by this experience.</p>
<p>Although you move on with life, that experience often pops up in the back of your mind or even in your dreams at night and affects your day-to-day well-being. You’re not being oversensitive or overreacting about this situation, despite how you might try to trivialize the experience.</p>
<p>In time, however, you realize that you’re safe and that none of the things this stranger said to you have stuck. A friend might have encouraged you and reminded you of all the times you were a decent person. You can rationalize that this person doesn’t know you, and that whatever statements they made came from a place of ignorance and were idle threats.</p>
<p>Eventually, the emotions from this experience begin to subside and vanish. Ultimately, the experience was like tripping and scraping your knee. It was painful at the time, but it caused no lasting damage.</p>
<h3><strong>Maladaptive Memories</strong></h3>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes we experience something that takes ages to heal, affecting us for years and even decades after it happened. These memories are like complex, infected injuries that will only heal when a doctor inspects them and prescribes treatment. This is where EMDR comes in.</p>
<p>When we experience something traumatic, our bodies take a kind of screenshot of what happened. These screenshots contain information that our nervous system consults to avoid similar future experiences. It remembers details, including sounds, smells, the time of day, the location of the event, the body language of the people involved, their tone of voice, facial expressions, and the emotions and physical sensations you felt at the time.</p>
<p>These trauma screenshots are known as maladaptive memories. Maladaptive memories are like excessively large files on a computer system, taking up space and requiring a lot of energy to process. Our brains tend to keep these maladaptive memories open and running in the background, as they constantly scan for information related to the trauma screenshot.</p>
<p>This is a neurological function that is designed to keep us from danger. But it backfires. With a maladaptive memory constantly awake and scanning for danger, the trauma will never heal sufficiently for us to move on.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it-2.jpg"><img alt="emdr treatment " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-85900" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it-2.jpg" width="300" /></a>To continue with the computer analogy, a maladaptive memory is hard to shut down because, unlike an adaptive memory, you can’t find where the maladaptive memory is stored. Despite how prominent it feels and how regularly it interferes with all your other mental and emotional processes, it is like a program that exists without a path or filename to follow and locate.</p>
<p>In the example of arguing with a stranger online, you were able to connect that experience to real-life experiences and test the validity of that person’s statements and threats. EMDR treatment allows you to convert the maladaptive memory and store it in your brain as an adaptive memory.</p>
<h3>How EMDR Treatment Works</h3>
<p>Maladaptive memories affect the part of your brain known as the amygdala. Most of your emotions, trauma responses, and survival instincts come from this part of your brain. Ordinarily, the amygdala is connected to the part of your brain responsible for logic, understanding, and reason, known as the prefrontal cortex. Together, the logical and emotional parts of your brain work together to help you process trauma.</p>
<p>However, maladaptive memories often cause the neural pathways in your brain to break down. This means that the emotions connected to that past experience always feel real and present because they are not connected to the logical part of your brain. When your eyes follow the back-and-forth movements in EMDR treatment, something happens in your brain. The eye movements help open the neural pathways in your brain, allowing emotions and reason to communicate with each other again.</p>
<p>This ultimately calms your nervous system and brings you out of survival mode, as your nervous system begins to understand that the threat is in the past, and that you are not in any present danger.</p>
<p>In the 1990 film <em>Home Alone</em>, young Kevin McCallister is accidentally abandoned by his family and has to brave the holidays on his own. One of the tasks he must face is doing laundry. The washing machine is located in the basement next to a scary-looking furnace.</p>
<p>To him, the furnace looks like a hungry monster waiting to devour him. It is only after facing some genuine threats and having some positive experiences that he can go into the basement and tell the furnace monster to “shut up.” His brain is finally able to distinguish real threats from imagined ones.</p>
<p>This is a picture of what EMDR does for people and who benefits most from it. Our monsters might be unveiled to be nothing other than shadows on the wall, or echoes from the past. You are not weak for experiencing continued trauma from a past event, and you are not beyond help either.</p>

<title>9 Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s not always easy to know when you are in an emotionally abusive relationship, even when there is regular conflict. Confrontations and fights are not always a bad thing, because sometimes it’s better to express yourself and deal with the consequences of being a little too honest. However, some people are consistently defensive, manipulative, and skilled at avoiding accountability while making you feel at fault.</p>
<p>If someone defaults to being toxic or emotionally abusive, whether in their daily communication or the way they handle confrontations, it can be hard to call things out. When you can see the signs of emotional abuse in a relationship, you can begin to hold them accountable for this behavior and avoid constantly feeling like the guilty party.</p>
<h3>Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship</h3>
<p>Not everyone who causes conflict or has big emotions in a relationship is emotionally abusive. However, this is exactly how so many truly toxic people get away with using emotionally abusive tactics in a relationship. They tend to know exactly what to say, how to say it, and when to shift focus to avoid being held accountable for having to apologize.</p>
<p><img alt="9 Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship" class="alignleft wp-image-44146" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-signs-of-emotional-abuse-in-a-relationship-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Though you might not realize that your partner is emotionally abusive, you will eventually begin to feel unwell from being made into the antagonist of the narrative they have constructed. It’s also good to know the signs of emotional abuse in a relationship because these are tactics that you could end up falling for and using yourself, if only to escape carrying the unfair share of the blame.</p>
<p>In the context of an intimate relationship, whether romantic or not, some toxicity will inevitably spill out from time to time. Everyone has some degree of darkness and hurt in them, and at some point, it will come to the surface. When we talk about signs of emotional abuse in a relationship, we are talking about consistent patterns of behavior, not occasional tendencies. Here are some of the most common signs of emotional abuse in a relationship:</p>
<p><strong>Constantly playing the victim</strong> Some people have never learned that they are allowed to make mistakes and that they can make amends when they do. They are so used to playing the victim that they do it subconsciously, even when they are the perpetrators of injustice or emotional abuse. They frame every situation as one that gave them no choice in how to act, and they are often incredibly convincing.</p>
<p>Many people who play the victim are convinced that they are the victim and will resist accepting another point of view. One of the ways to know if your partner constantly plays the victim is to ask yourself how often you feel like the bad guy, because there can’t be two victims in regular conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Never apologizing</strong> Along with constantly playing the victim, emotionally abusive people will never apologize because they are convinced that they have nothing to apologize for. There are different ways of apologizing, whether it is acknowledging your hurt and their part in it, or making efforts to right their wrongs.</p>
<p>Emotionally abusive people will do none of these things but will expect you to do these things for them. When you are with an emotionally abusive partner, you will often feel like their parent, teacher, therapist, or even their boss because of how little responsibility they take for things.</p>
<p><strong>Shifting the focus to avoid accountability</strong> Related to these abusive tactics, one of the clear signs of emotional abuse is when people try to cause diversions or distractions in the middle of a confrontation. They do this so that they can avoid being held responsible for harm or taking accountability for any of their actions.</p>
<p>As soon as the topic starts hitting a little too close to home, they will pivot the conversation, shift focus from themselves, or act out in a distracting way to throw you off kilter. When they start gaslighting you as a part of these escape tactics, you might genuinely begin to feel like you have misunderstood the situation and might eventually let them off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>Making excuses or long-winded explanations to avoid apologizing</strong> You can often discern a dishonest person by the level of detail their explanations have. Truly innocent people tend not to remember precise details of events, whereas people who have had time to rehearse their excuses will add unnecessary details.</p>
<p>One of the ways that emotionally abusive people avoid being caught in their wrongdoing is to provide elaborate and articulate excuses and explanations to explain their supposedly innocent behavior. It’s best to stop them in their tracks and call them on this tactic before they get a chance to share more of their stories.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="9 Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship 1" class="alignright wp-image-44147" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-signs-of-emotional-abuse-in-a-relationship-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Minimizing or dismissing what you say</strong> If there is one tactic emotionally abusive people love to use during an argument, it’s minimizing or dismissing your point of view. They might call you over-emotional, hypersensitive, or worse. The sad part is that this tactic is often effective. You are often left feeling hurt and angered by whatever they did to cause the argument in the first place, and stung by their dismissal of your reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Telling you how you should feel</strong> Statements like, “You have no right to be upset about this,” or “You really need to get over this,” are emotionally abusive things to say, regardless of context. Even during the times when you might overreact, your feelings were not fake or disingenuous.</p>
<p>A mature partner would observe and react to your emotions, weighing your responses. If your responses were disproportionate, they would help you see it. Trying to tell you how you should feel is a sign of emotional abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawing and being silent when they are angry</strong> Some people go silent and withdraw when they are angry because they are trying to regulate their emotions. They take time and space to process their thoughts and feelings, and to resolve the issue when they are in a calmer and clearer state of mind. This is healthy and mature, but it is not the same reason emotionally abusive people withdraw when they are angry.</p>
<p>Emotionally abusive people use distance and silence as a way to control the situation and manipulate you into making the first move of reconciliation on their terms. They are not trying to regulate their emotions, but are stewing in their anger until it turns bitter.</p>
<p><strong>Accusing you of doing things that they are guilty of doing</strong> It often happens in cases of cheating and infidelity where the guilty party accuses the other of the very thing they are doing. Emotionally abusive people are often aware of what they are doing wrong and will try to skew the narrative by projecting their guilt onto you.</p>
<p>As absurd as their accusations can be, it is still hurtful to be accused of things that you have never done. All because they are trying to avoid being found out and having to come clean.</p>
<p><strong>Making everything a personal attack when they are angry</strong> In any relationship, there will be times when emotions run high, and things get heated. During these times, it’s not uncommon for people to say things that they will later regret, even if those things were true.</p>
<p>Emotionally abusive people, however, have a habit of cutting right to the core in blunt, harmful ways every time you fight. They do this to catch you off guard and gain an upper hand in the argument, and it is a toxic and emotionally abusive tactic.</p>
<h3>Getting Free from Emotional Abuse</h3>
<p>It can take time to recognize the signs of emotional abuse, and even longer to figure out what to do next. If your partner is open to taking their share of responsibility and healing, there are options like couples counseling and individual therapy that could help the relationship. However, many emotionally abusive people have no interest in working to fix things, and you might have to start focusing on doing what is best for you to move on.</p>
<p>A big part of healing is in focusing on yourself and discovering what it is you need most in life. It helps to talk things through with someone who has experience and insight into relationships and people, like a counselor. If you would like to find a counselor to talk to, please contact us.</p>

<title>Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>There is something about the dawn of a new year. Maybe it’s embracing a fresh start, righting the wrongs, or doing the things we didn’t have time to do over the last twelve months. For some people, starting a new “year” happens every 90 days as they focus on their goals.</p>
<p>Often, people resolve to lose weight or fix body image issues each year. Many of those people set the same goal year after year. Sometimes, this is due to unrealistic goals and expectations. When we don’t meet our goals, we feel worse, and negative body image issues creep up, interfering with our relationships and social lives.</p>
<h3>How to Overcome Body Image Issues</h3>
<p>Body image is how we think, perceive, and feel about our bodies. It is our behavior regarding our body appearance, shape, size, and weight. Poor body image can lead to body image issues. How often have you perused a magazine and compared your body to the model&#8217;s or actor’s body? Do you obsess over the latest celebrity diet because you want to look like them? Do you make disparaging remarks about your own body or appearance, even in jest?</p>
<img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year 1" class="alignleft wp-image-57215" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />With the invention of social media, more people are having trouble with body image issues. We follow influencers, scroll through an old classmate’s pictures, and post about our own struggles with weight, size, or appearance. Your body image issues may be ingrained in you from childhood, or you may have developed them recently after a weight gain, pregnancy, stressful event, menopause, or the aging process.</p>
<p>It is possible to learn to accept your body where it is and love it while you pursue health. The following are several tips for overcoming body image issues.</p>
<p><strong>Remember you are made in His image and likeness</strong>
<blockquote><p><em>Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” so God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</em> – <strong>Genesis 1:26-27, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the book of Genesis, we learn that God created us in His image and likeness. God, one of the Trinity, chose to make human beings mirror Him. We often forget that when we look in the mirror.</p>
<p>We are a reflection of God, but we only see our human frailties and what we consider flaws. The next time you look in the mirror, reflect on God’s words. Know that God created you just as you are and wants you to care for your body by not abusing, neglecting, or disparaging it.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year 2" class="alignright wp-image-57216" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-3-334x500.jpg" width="200" />Comparison is a thief</strong></p>
<p>“Comparison is the thief of joy.” Most of us are familiar with this quote from Theodore Roosevelt, yet we compare our bodies and lives with those of others anyway. Comparison is a tough habit to break. We compare our possessions, finances, marriages, children, homes, careers, and bodies to others.</p>
<p>We use this comparison as a scale to measure our success. We know that each individual has their own problems and hidden issues that they never show the world, but we compare and beat ourselves up for not measuring up.</p>
<p>When it comes to body image issues, we need to be less judgmental about other people’s appearances. Note your thoughts when you see someone else. Do you judge them by appearance, beauty, shape, size, or weight? This only feeds your own insecurities. Instead, note the good things about someone. This subtle mindset shift will spill over into how you view yourself. Instead of pointing out your flaws, you may appreciate what you like best about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Limit social and print media</strong></p>
<p>Comparison is a problem. It is easy to do with social, digital, and print media. We see our favorite actors and celebrities on television and in magazines looking svelte and thin, and we want desperately to have that type of “success.” We forget that these images are highly edited and filtered.</p>
<p>Limit your exposure to media that makes you feel not good enough. For example, instead of mindlessly scrolling social media during a break, quickly check your notifications and find something else to do. Cutting back on screen time helps your mental health and relieves eye strain.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year" class="alignleft wp-image-57214" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Learn to accept compliments</strong></p>
<p>If you hide behind self-deprecating humor when someone pays you a compliment, you are only hurting yourself and further tearing down your own body image. Ask yourself why you cannot accept the compliment. Is it because you don’t believe the other person really means it? Do you think you are not worthy of people appreciating you? Do you feel like a fake, and if they only knew the “real” you, they wouldn’t say that?</p>
<p>These thoughts and beliefs go much deeper and probably fuel your poor body image issues. They may stem from childhood abuse, trauma, or neglect. You may have been abused or betrayed by someone you loved and now cannot see past the hurt. You are worthy of love, respect, and honor. You might not feel like that’s true right now, but it is. Learn to accept the compliments with a thank you. Seek counseling if you need help with self-esteem, confidence, and self-worth.</p>
<p><strong>Lean toward health, not “diet” culture</strong></p>
<p>Poor body image can cause us to jump into diet culture and try trendy new diets for quick results. But these “quick fixes” only cause us to focus more on the body. Instead of focusing on losing weight, wearing a specific size, or toning up a body part, lean toward getting healthy.</p>
<p>When health becomes our number one focus, everything else will eventually fall into line. Set health goals, not weight or size goals. Instead of overwhelming yourself with New Year’s resolutions, set goals to promote your health today.</p>
<p>For example, instead of stating a goal of never eating sugar again this year (only to slip and eat a piece of candy on day three), focus only on today. For today, you will plan your meals without sugar. Then, focus on one meal at a time. Focus on your health in small time periods as these days will compound.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on performance, not ideals</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year 3" class="alignright wp-image-57217" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-4-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Those hefty New Year’s resolutions of joining the gym, working out every day, or losing fifty pounds in in twelve months, can be unrealistic which only leads to giving up. Most of us set large and unrealistic goals and then felt bad when we didn’t follow through. This may have fed a belief that you never finish anything. You can finish. We all can, but only by focusing on consistent performance instead of the ideals we have in our heads.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the results, which can worsen body image issues if you don’t reach them quickly enough by your standards, focus on performance. Use a calendar to mark if you did specific tasks to reach your destination that day.</p>
<p>For example, if working out will help you achieve your goals, focus on giving yourself a fun sticker on the wall calendar for each day you work out. You could use different stickers for various activities. The streak in activity will grow, and eventually, you will see results without feeling overwhelmed. Concentrate on those consistent activities.</p>
<h3>Seek help with body image issues</h3>
<p>If body image issues cause turmoil in your relationships, social life, and daily activities, or if you have developed anxiety and depression over your appearance, body shape, size, or weight, consider having some sessions with a therapist.</p>
<p>People face body dissatisfaction for various reasons, but you can overcome body image issues as you continue to get physically and mentally healthy. If you are ready for that journey, contact our office today to schedule an appointment with a counselor. Make this New Year the best yet.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-8 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-7 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-8"><p>When it comes to therapy, maybe you think you’ve seen it all. You’ve talked through your past, named your emotions, practiced the breathing exercises, and learned every coping strategy your therapist could offer.</p>
<p>You’ve put in the work, yet somehow you still don’t feel better. You still can’t sleep well, your body still reacts like the danger is happening now, or you still walk around feeling disconnected and on edge, especially if you have unresolved trauma.</p>
<p>PTSD affects more than just your thoughts. It changes how your body reacts to stress, how your brain stays alert all the time, and how hard it is to feel safe, even when you are. That’s why regular counseling sometimes isn’t enough.</p>
<p>PTSD therapies are designed for people whose trauma lives not just in their memories, but in their muscles, reactions, and nervous system. They work with the parts of trauma that words can’t always reach.</p>
<p>Following, you’ll find details on why some types of therapy feel more helpful than others, and what kinds of alternatives are out there for people who want to heal from trauma without retelling everything that happened.</p>
<h3>What Makes PTSD Therapies Different</h3>
<p>Some therapies are created specifically for people who’ve been through trauma. If your heart races for no clear reason, if you flinch at sounds, or feel numb when you should feel something, sometimes those are real trauma responses. PTSD therapies help ease those reactions. They don’t just focus on your thoughts; they help your body feel calmer, too.</p>
<p>Some of these therapies use movement or gentle exercises. Others use sound, eye movements, or creative activities. What they all share is a whole-person approach. They treat trauma as something that affects your entire system, not just your brain.</p>
<p>If you feel that talking through your trauma hasn’t helped as much as you hoped, this may just be a sign that you need something different.</p>
<h3>When You Might Need More Than Talk Therapy</h3>
<ul>
<li>You still have nightmares or flashbacks, even after discussing the trauma.</li>
<li>You feel cut off from your emotions or body.</li>
<li>You’ve learned coping tools, but you still don’t feel safe.</li>
<li>You avoid certain people, places, or sounds without fully knowing why.</li>
<li>You leave sessions feeling drained, not better.</li>
<li>You’ve stopped talking about the trauma because it feels pointless or too upsetting.</li>
</ul>
<p>These signs can mean that your trauma needs more than words. PTSD therapies are built for this kind of healing.</p>
<p>Traditional talk therapy isn’t the only way to heal. For some people, retelling what happened can be painful, and for some, it makes things worse. Some don’t even have clear memories of what happened, and that’s okay. The good news is that there are alternatives that can still help just as well, or sometimes better, even without sharing your full story.</p>
<h3>Ten Alternative Therapies That Do Things Differently</h3>
<p><strong>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)</strong> Uses eye movements to help the brain sort out traumatic memories in a new way.</p>
<p><strong>Somatic Experiencing</strong> Focuses on physical sensations to release stress that’s stuck in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Sensorimotor Psychotherapy</strong> Uses small movements and awareness of the body to manage trauma reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Neurofeedback</strong> Helps retrain brain patterns linked to PTSD using brainwave feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Family Systems (IFS)</strong> Helps you understand and connect with different parts of yourself, without needing to explain everything out loud.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART)</strong> Uses guided images and eye movements to reduce the intensity of painful memories.</p>
<p><strong>Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises (TRE)</strong> Involves simple physical exercises that help the body release deep stress.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness-Based PTSD Therapies</strong> Uses breathing and body awareness to bring calm, without revisiting the past.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma-Informed Yoga</strong> Combines movement and breathing to help you feel more at home in your body.</p>
<p><strong>Music or Art Therapy</strong> Gives you creative ways to process what you’ve been through without using words.</p>
<p>These therapies take different paths, but they all offer healing without forcing you to relive painful experiences.</p>
<h3>Relearning How to Trust Yourself After Trauma</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of living with trauma isn’t just the memories, it’s the way you stop trusting your own reactions. You might second guess how you feel, doubt your instincts, or disconnect from your body completely. This can make everyday life feel confusing or unsafe, even when there’s no clear reason.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25907" height="200" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty-images-RhrlNR_SGHg-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></strong>Alternative trauma therapies can help with more than calming your nervous system. They can also help you rebuild a relationship with yourself. Therapies that focus on movement, sensation, and body awareness help you tune in, instead of shutting down. Over time, this makes it easier to recognize what your body is trying to tell you, whether it’s a feeling of safety, discomfort, or a need to rest.</p>
<p>Instead of pushing through or ignoring your reactions, these therapies help you respond to them with more trust and understanding. That can make a huge difference in how you handle stress, relationships, and decisions. You don’t just feel calmer; you start to feel more confident in your own skin again.</p>
<p>Different people respond to different therapies. What works for someone else might not be the right fit for you. Choosing a therapy depends on what you’re dealing with and what feels manageable.</p>
<h3>How to Find the Right PTSD Therapy for You</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your body feels tense or frozen, or disconnected from your body, a body-based therapy like somatic experiencing or trauma-informed yoga could help.</li>
<li>If you struggle with intrusive thoughts or have strong or repeated memories, EMDR or ART might be useful.</li>
<li>If talking feels uncomfortable, neurofeedback, art therapy, or expressive therapies may feel safer.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also helps to check and make sure the therapist has specific training in trauma-focused methods. Just because someone offers therapy doesn’t always mean they’re equipped to handle PTSD. Ask about certifications, ongoing education, or supervision in trauma work. These details can make a big difference in how safe and effective your therapy experience feels.</p>
<p>A therapist trained in the specific type of PTSD therapy can walk you through what’s available and help you find something that fits your needs. You don’t have to guess your way through it. What matters is finding something that feels respectful and doable for you.</p>
<p>Not every therapist is trained to do deep trauma work. If you’re looking for someone who can offer PTSD therapy advice, the first step is to ask a few questions. Look for someone who understands how PTSD affects the body and nervous system, not just thoughts and behaviors.</p>
<h3>How to Choose a Therapist for PTSD Therapies</h3>
<p>Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What experience do you have with trauma or PTSD therapy?</li>
<li>Do you use any approaches that focus on the body or nervous system?</li>
<li>What do you do if someone isn’t ready to talk about their trauma?</li>
</ul>
<p>A therapist who understands this field will answer these questions openly. They’ll explain how alternative therapies work and make sure you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Some therapists also focus on specific kinds of trauma, like military experiences, childhood abuse, or cultural issues. Others offer faith-informed care or culturally sensitive approaches. The most important thing is to find someone who respects your story and knows how to treat trauma with care.</p>
<p>If you’ve been trying to feel better and nothing seems to work, it’s okay to try something new. If you’re not sure whether your symptoms are trauma-related, or if you’re curious about what kind of therapy could help, this is a good place to begin. Many therapists listed on this platform are trained in PTSD therapies and understand what you’re going through.</p>
<p>You can reach out, ask questions, or set up a first appointment when you’re ready. You don’t have to figure it all out by yourself. Help is here, and it’s designed for what you’ve lived through.</p>
<p>Call our reception team today to find someone who can help.</p>

<title>Finding Peace Through Purging: How Decluttering Can Lead to Stress Reduction</title>
<link>https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/articles/finding-peace-through-purging-how-decluttering-can-lead-to-stress-reduction</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/?p=6901</guid>

<description><![CDATA[<p>There is an invisible burden attached to each item that you own. This burden accumulates in your mind and creates layers of stress that you may not know are present. Walking through your home calls for your brain to make mini decisions about what needs attention or organization. The constant mental processing that your brain engages in creates a low level of stress.</p>
<p>Stress reduction through purging can offer more than a clean home. It can bring mental clarity. This is a pathway to spiritual freedom that aligns with God’s desire for your life.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. – </em><strong>Matthew 6:19-21, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>The Hidden Weight of Excess Possession</h3>
<p>Having a relationship with material possessions can create a web of emotional and psychological connections that ultimately impact your stress level. Visual color has been known to compete for attention, decrease performance, and increase cortisol production. Being continuously surrounded by excess items, your nervous system remains in a state of high alert and constantly scans and processes the environment around you.</p>
<p>This stress-causing issue is deeper than a simple organizational problem. Each possession represents a decision, a responsibility, and a piece of mental energy allocated. The stack of magazines that were intended to be read, clothes that no longer fit, and kitchen gadgets that are no longer used represent a “cognitive load.” This load causes your brain to expend energy, managing the mental inventory of possessions, leaving less capacity for priorities.</p>
<p>The cognitive burden begins to manifest physically in your body due to the increased cortisol levels, elevated blood pressure, and disrupted sleep. People living in an unorganized environment tend to have higher stress responses than those in an organized space. The possessions that were intended to support your life become sources of chronic tension that affect mental health and spiritual well-being.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Then He said to them, “Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.”</em> – <strong>Luke 12:15, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Creating Sacred Space Through Intentional Stress Reduction</h3>
<p>Intentional decluttering turns into more than just organization. It becomes a spiritual discipline that creates space for God’s presence in your life. Removing the excess that clutters your physical environment clears mental and emotional space for a deeper connection with God.</p>
<p>When you purge, you are mirroring the spiritual practice of confession and repentance. This releases what no longer serves your highest good to make room for the transformative work of God.</p>
<p>When you create order in your physical space, you are reflecting God’s nature and character. Just as God brought order from chaos in creation, you continue this when you establish peace and organization in your home. It’s not about perfectionism or control. This is about steering your space in honor of God and supporting your mental health. When your home becomes a sanctuary, you create conditions that naturally reduce stress and promote emotional well-being.</p>
<p>The transformation that occurs through stress reduction affects more than your immediate surroundings. When you successfully declutter your space, you will notice improved focus, better decision-making, and enhanced creativity. This results in benefits that align with biblical principles of stewardship and intentional living, according to God’s word. Removing distractions creates space for deeper contemplation, prayer, and spiritual growth.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints. – </em><strong>1 Corinthians 14:33, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>The Stress Reduction Process: Steps to Meaningful Decluttering</h3>
<p>When you start your journey toward stress reduction by decluttering, it will require practical strategies and emotional preparation. You will be challenged to examine your relationship with material possessions and confront any underlying beliefs that drive accumulation.</p>
<img alt="Finding Peace Through Purging: How Decluttering Can Lead to Stress Reduction" class="alignleft wp-image-6902" height="199" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-peace-through-purging-how-decluttering-can-lead-to-stress-reduction-310x206.jpg" width="300" />The best way to start the process is with one small area. This will allow you to build momentum as you experience the relief that comes with creating order. The results will be tackling larger spaces with confidence.</p>
<p>Sometimes the emotional work of letting go proves to be more challenging than the physical act of sorting and discarding items. Some possessions carry memories, represent investments, or symbolize future possibilities that you hesitate to release.</p>
<p>Christian counselors often help clients navigate attachment issues by understanding the difference between honoring memories and the enslavement of objects. You can cherish the significance of experiences without having to save every physical reminder.</p>
<p>You will discover patterns in your accumulation habits that reveal deeper truths as you work through the decluttering process. You may have items that represent security status or possible future needs. When you understand motivations, you can address the root cause of the clutter and develop healthier relationships with your possessions. The goal is not to rid your life of belongings, but to keep what truly serves your life and aligns with your values.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things to be loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish</em> so <em>that I may gain Christ.</em> – <strong>Philippians 3:7-8, NASB</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Maintaining Peace through Mindful Consumption</h3>
<p>The benefits of stress reduction require that you develop new habits for acquiring new items. If there is no change in the purchasing patterns or decision-making process, the clutter will eventually return. That will include the stress that you are seeking to remove from your life. In this phase of transformation, you will find that you have cultivated contentment with what you have and what you allow into your life.</p>
<p>There are mindful questions that you can ask yourself as you pause before purchases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I truly need this item?</li>
<li>Will it add genuine value to my life?</li>
<li>Am I buying this to fill an emotional need that could be met in a healthier way?</li>
<li>Is this purchase out of boredom?</li>
</ul>
<p>Impulse purchasing is a result of stress, boredom, or an attempt to regulate emotions. It is necessary to address these underlying triggers to break the cycle of accumulation that undermines peace.</p>
<p>Christian counselors can help you develop what is called a “gratitude inventory.” This is a regular practice of acknowledging and appreciating what you already own. Through this spiritual discipline, you will shift your focus from what’s lacking to what is abundant in your life.</p>
<p>This shift results in the natural reduction of the urge to fill the voids with material items. The gratitude practice also improves sleep quality and creates a positive cycle that supports mental wellness and simplified living.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment. For we have brought nothing into the world,</em> so <em>we cannot take anything out of it either. If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.</em> – <strong>1 Timothy 6:6-8, NASB</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Finding Peace</h3>
<p>As you continue your journey toward stress reduction through intentional decluttering, you will not only have a tidy home but a pathway to spiritual and emotional freedom. This freedom is the lifestyle God desires for you to live.</p>
<p>Releasing the excess that weighs down your spirit creates space for peace that surpasses the understanding of this world. This type of transformation will require courage as you examine your relationships, material possessions, and wisdom to distinguish what serves your life and what occupies space.</p>
<p>Remember, the goal isn’t perfection but progress toward a life that aligns with God’s word and supports your mental well-being. The piece you create by intentionally coloring your home becomes a gift to yourself and your family, as well as a relationship with God.</p>

<title>Common Misconceptions About DBT for Teens</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Latoya’s relationship with food had always been complicated, and though she had heard of DBT for teens working for some of her peers, she had no idea how it could help her. Latoya’s eating disorder developed gradually over several years. Her journey toward needing DBT for teens was a complex interplay of psychological, emotional, and social factors.</p>
<p>These were the stages in the development of Latoya’s teen eating disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Early Onset</strong> Latoya started struggling with food issues like comfort eating as early as she could remember, but by the age of fourteen, her challenges developed into a dangerous disorder. By this age, she started transitioning into bulimia, which is characterized by cycles of binge eating followed by purging.</p>
<p><strong>Body Image Issues</strong> Throughout her teenage years, Latoya’s body image issues became more intense, and she became increasingly dissatisfied with her appearance, with a constant obsession to control her weight.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Triggers</strong> Latoya’s eating disorder was rooted in emotional distress from financial problems at home that started when her dad was laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic, and she used food as a way to cope with her emotions, which led to unhealthy eating patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Early Intervention</strong> Latoya did not receive effective help early on due to several factors we will address later on, and this lack of intervention allowed her eating disorder to worsen over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens.jpg"><img alt="dbt for teens" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-62006" height="300" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens.jpg" width="200" /></a><strong>Transition to Disorder</strong> By the time she reached her sophomore year of high school, Latoya’s eating disorder had transformed into anorexia. She became increasingly obsessed with staying a specific weight to be happy with herself.</p>
<p>Eventually, the eating disorder led to severe health issues for her. Her days were consumed by thoughts of food and her body image. She avoided eating as much as possible and constantly weighed herself, driven by the belief that reaching a certain weight would make her happy.</p>
<p>It was only when Latoya started showing alarming signs of weight loss that her family and friends became deeply concerned and decided that she needed to get help. She was registered in a treatment program where she was introduced to dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which focused on teaching her skills to manage her emotions and develop a healthier relationship with food.</p>
<h3>Understanding DBT for Teenagers</h3>
<p>DBT is a specialized form of therapy designed to help adolescents manage intense emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms. It combines cognitive-behavioral techniques with concepts of mindfulness and acceptance.</p>
<p>This behavioral therapy model was developed in the 1980s by American psychologist Dr. Marsha Linehan, who realized that the traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone might not be effective enough for young patients with chronic self-destructive behaviors.</p>
<p>DBT for teens can be particularly effective for those dealing with issues like anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicidal ideation, or even borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>The idea is to practically equip them with the tools to navigate the challenges of adolescence more effectively.</p>
<h3>Key Components of DBT for Teens</h3>
<p>This therapy form has a philosophical basis on the dialectical process of balancing acceptance and change, which is what its name alludes to. It is also being adapted to treat various conditions, including mood disorders, substance use, and PTSD.</p>
<p>Here are its key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual therapy is meant to focus on problem-solving and addressing specific issues or maladaptive behaviors.</li>
<li>Skills training to teach teens practical skills in areas such as mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.</li>
<li>Providing real-time support to help teens apply DBT skills in their daily lives through phone coaching.</li>
<li>Involving the family in therapy sessions and skills training to support the teen’s progress.</li>
<li>Teaching that balances acceptance and change through unique models tailored for teens, such as “Walking the Middle Path.”</li>
<li>DBT for young people integrates standard CBT techniques with concepts of mindfulness, acceptance, and distress tolerance, drawing from contemplative meditation practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Latoya’s treatment might have started earlier in her life, but her treatment only started after her situation had escalated because no one thought her family problems would affect a child in the way they did.</p>
<p>In her community, among some of the wealthiest people in her state, financial struggles were not as easy to talk about or recognize. She didn’t seem to have the same kind of problem as other peers who received DBT for teens therapy early on.</p>
<p>This lack of intervention is often deeply entrenched in communities and driven by several myths that can lead to misunderstandings about its purpose and effectiveness, which can be held even by people who know about this kind of therapy.</p>
<h3>Common Misconceptions About DBT for Teens</h3>
<p><strong>Only teens with severe issues need DBT</strong> </p>
<p>Many people believe it is a highly complex therapy designed only for extreme behaviors or severe mental health issues, yet it can also benefit teens dealing with everyday issues like heartbreak, pubescent stress, and bullying. It teaches valuable skills for managing emotions and improving relationships.</p>
<p><strong>It is only another form of talk therapy</strong> </p>
<p>DBT is not like traditional talk therapy but is structured and skills-based, focusing on teaching practical techniques for emotional regulation, mindfulness, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens-2.jpg"><img alt="dbt for teens " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-81645" height="191" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens-2.jpg" width="300" /></a><strong>DBT concepts and skills are too complex for teenagers</strong> </p>
<p>People think it is too complicated for young minds to understand and use, yet it is tailored to be accessible for teens, with modules and exercises customized for their developmental level. Therapists use age-appropriate lingo, activities, and examples to make the skills relatable.</p>
<p><strong>Teens are required to commit to DBT for the long term</strong> </p>
<p>Some believe that the teen will require years of therapy to see any benefits, but while long-term commitment can enhance outcomes, many start to experience significant improvements in a relatively short period, usually within a few months.</p>
<p><strong>DBT is just for the individual teen</strong> </p>
<p>The therapy is designed to not only focus on the teenager while excluding their immediate family, but their involvement is one of the most integral parts of DBT for teens. Family members or caregivers are often involved in sessions and skills training to support the teen’s progress and improve family dynamics.</p>
<p>DBT therapy is a process that provides tools and skills that require practice and commitment while helping teens build resilience and healthier coping mechanisms over time. Understanding these misconceptions can help set realistic expectations and highlight the true benefits.</p>
<p>During her treatment, Letoya practiced being present in the moment, which helped her become more aware of her thoughts and feelings without judgment. She learned techniques to cope with difficult emotions and situations without resorting to harmful behaviors.</p>
<p>DBT trained Letoya to improve her communication skills, which helped her build stronger, more supportive relationships with her family and friends. Most importantly, gradually she discovered ways to regulate, understand, and manage her intense emotions, reducing the urge to control her life through food.</p>
<p>Through consistent practice of these skills, she has already started looking and feeling healthier and happier. She is still working on challenging her negative thoughts about food and her body, replacing them with more positive and realistic ones.</p>
<p>Now that she has been discharged from the treatment center after several months of intensive therapy, Letoya wants to use the DBT skills she has learned and remains committed to her recovery.</p>
<h3>Next Steps: Christian Counseling for Teens</h3>
<p>Every teenager has their own unique struggles, especially during this tricky phase of life. However, sometimes a teen can need extra help if they have fallen into unhealthy patterns and behaviors that harm their bodies or mental well-being.</p>

Not all relationships are enriching, meaningful, connected, or safe. That happens for a variety of reasons, but it is also not a permanent or unchangeable state. One key to having fulfilling relationships is to have a healthy attachment style. While this doesn’t guarantee a great relationship, it certainly sets you up for success.</p>
<p>This article will explore what a healthy attachment style is, the ways it supports relationships and their flourishing, and how to nurture a healthy attachment style. Even if you don’t currently have a healthy attachment style, it’s possible to move in that direction by taking deliberate and consistent steps.</p>
<h3>Healthy relationships matter</h3>
<p>One of the things that makes our lives worthwhile is our relationships. The most significant moments we experience are with another person, or they involve others witnessing the event. Getting a new job you’ve always dreamed of is amazing; what’s even more amazing is being able to share that news with your family, friends, Bible study group, or anyone who’ll listen. Good and beautiful things become more so when shared with others.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6299" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty-images-fMOOQ8MNRkY-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Whether it’s about a new job, graduating, getting rid of college debt, enjoying a delicious meal, watching a thought-provoking movie, taking in a beautiful sunset or sunrise, or watching a baby take her first steps, these moments are often better when other people share them with us. Their delight becomes our delight, and our delight becomes theirs. This is what relationships do at their best.</p>
<p>Relationships affect a lot, including our flourishing. That’s why, even when everything else is going well in your life, if your relationships are in a state of disrepair, it’s quite likely that you won’t have a high level of satisfaction. Healthy relationships are a good predictor of flourishing, even if you’re facing struggles in other areas. When trouble or adversity comes, it’s better to face it with others than alone (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12).</p>
<h3>Understanding Healthy Attachment Style</h3>
<p>Where then does having a healthy attachment style fit in? The concept of attachment styles was developed by a psychologist named John Bowlby. The idea was then later expanded upon by Mary Ainsworth. At its most basic, attachment styles describe how we form emotional connections with other people. A healthy attachment style, for instance, has the hallmarks of trust, ease with intimacy, mutual support, and openness.</p>
<p>There are other attachment styles, including fearful and avoidant attachment. These styles, just like the healthy style, are rooted in life experiences. Being consistently nurtured will likely result in a better ability to express your needs while carrying the expectation that they’ll be met. Inconsistent caregiving, on the other hand, can result in distrusting others or being afraid to make connections because they may break easily.</p>
<p>When you have a healthy or secure attachment style, you can approach your relationships with confidence. You know that you’re worthy of love, and you’re equipped to love others well in return. You’re not afraid to be open because your life experiences have taught you that being open is okay. Being vulnerable and open doesn’t mean you’re going to get hurt.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6300" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty-images-caO-kxzDYYE-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />When you have a healthy attachment style, you can communicate openly, which helps you deal with conflict effectively. Relationships will always face challenges, whether they are internal or come from outside the relationship. When you do have relationship challenges, a healthy attachment style means you can recover from them without spiraling into fear or withdrawing from your partner, which tends to worsen conflict.</p>
<p>A healthy attachment style lays the groundwork for mutually fulfilling and resilient relationships that reflect God’s intentions for human connection.</p>
<h3>A healthy attachment style supports flourishing</h3>
<p>Healthy relationships offer a greater chance at thriving. The ability to form supportive, trusting relationships doesn’t remove the hardships that life throws at you, but it’s certainly easier to manage those hardships knowing you have people around you who have your back. Some of what a healthy attachment style brings to your life and relationships include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Openness and empathy</strong> You’re able to share your own needs, can listen well to others, and respond effectively and compassionately to their needs.</p>
<p>Emotional stability. When you have a healthy attachment, you’re better able to regulate your own emotions. One result is that you experience fewer extreme lows and highs because you feel secure and trust that your relationship is safe. A person with anxious attachment is on edge, and even small things can make them spiral, fearing the worst.</p>
<p><strong>Greater resilience</strong> When you have a secure and healthy connection with other people, it provides you with emotional support and a safety net. The verse cited earlier from Ecclesiastes highlights how important love and encouragement are when you’re facing life’s harder edges.</p>
<p>Having a healthy attachment style doesn’t mean you’ll never have conflict or challenging relationships. It does mean you’re well-placed to handle those challenges effectively. You are less likely to sabotage the relationship due to certain behaviors like being untrusting, closed off, or overly suspicious.</p>
<h3>Cultivating a Healthy Attachment Style</h3>
<p>Life presents us with many beautiful moments, and these are worth enjoying and celebrating. When you have a secure and healthy relationship, it is something worth celebrating. That kind of relationship brings a sense of stability, peace, and joy to one’s life. It’s an amazing thing to love others and be loved with a deep-seated sense of freedom.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6301" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shelby-murphy-figueroa-zezw9q2bc9E-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />As one celebrates such moments and seasons in their life, it’s important to do this with compassion and the awareness that many others have different experiences. Just as nurturing and supportive experiences help to shape a healthy attachment style, others are carrying the weight of painful experiences of betrayal, broken bonds, loss, abandonment, and more. These hardships make trust a difficult, or even unsafe, proposition.</p>
<p>Embracing the gift of a healthy attachment style and the benefits it brings shouldn’t lead one to dismiss others’ reality. Rather, it can inspire hope that growth and healing are possible for everyone.</p>
<p>If you recognize patterns of avoidant or anxious attachment in your life, remember that you’re not stuck, and your past doesn’t have the last word. There are practical ways for you to cultivate a healthier attachment style, and they include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Seek healing in Christ</strong> Your truest self and the bedrock of your identity can only be found in Christ. Root your identity in the Lord’s everlasting love (Romans 8:38-39). God isn’t like us – He doesn’t change His mind, He always tells the truth, and His intentions and actions are always and only ever good. He can be trusted. Go to Him to find security and carry that into other relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Self-reflect</strong> There may be patterns of behavior and thinking that you engage in without being aware of them. Take the time to pray and journal about this. You might notice triggers and patterns that require attention and change. You might find, for example, that you begin to spiral and have doubts when you don’t hear back promptly from your loved one.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6302" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/polina-kuzovkova-tTgEdXJVh1U-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Be vulnerable</strong> This is easier said than done, but the way to overcome the fear of being open is to slowly (and intentionally) practice vulnerability. Talk with trusted loved ones, providing opportunities for you to be known by them. Small, steady steps can build a greater sense of security.</p>
<p><strong>Consider professional guidance</strong> Surround yourself with nurturing and reliable people who can help you by reinforcing positive relational experiences. The impact of negative past experiences can be dealt with over time. Through professional counseling, for instance, you can rewire unhealthy patterns of thinking and learn new ways to connect with other people.</p>
<p>Your counselor can journey with you to cultivate a healthy attachment style that enriches your life and relationships. It is possible to flourish and enjoy healthy, secure relationships. Reach out to a counselor to pursue a more secure attachment style and the relational health that comes with it.</p>

<title>10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Codependency in the workplace doesn’t typically start with bad intentions. It usually begins with a desire to be helpful, reliable, or liked. Then, when one person starts relying too much on another for emotional support, validation, or even task completion, the balance tips. Over time, that helpfulness becomes too much.</p>
<p>In these situations, one person starts carrying more than their fair share, while the other becomes too comfortable leaning on them. This can happen between coworkers, between managers and their teams, or even between a person and their job. The helper feels needed. The other person feels taken care of. But eventually, both people lose out. The helper feels drained, and the other person doesn’t grow or take responsibility.</p>
<p>Recovering from codependency means learning to be valuable to each other without losing yourself for both parties.</p>
<h3>Professionals Who Struggle the Most with Work Codependency</h3>
<p>People who work in roles focused on helping others are especially at risk for workplace codependency. This includes teachers, therapists, healthcare workers, nonprofit staff, social workers, and people who work closely with clients.</p>
<img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57203" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-3-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Many such professionals tie their value to how much they give. The more they sacrifice, the more valuable they feel. Such a mindset can wear you down and lead to burnout. Once your sense of purpose depends on being useful, you may ignore your own needs, skip breaks, and stay quiet when your boundaries are crossed.</p>
<p>Even people who are great at their jobs can fall into this. High-performing professionals can fall into this trap, especially if they were raised to believe that helping others is the highest form of success. Often, it starts early in life, being taught that helping others is the most important thing you can do without any regard for your own well-being.</p>
<p>Codependency at work doesn’t always involve another person. Sometimes, it’s not a coworker or manager, it’s the job itself.</p>
<h3>How to Tell If You’re in a Codependent Relationship with Your Job</h3>
<p>Look through the following list and see if you can relate to any of these feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li>You feel guilty for taking time off, even if you’re sick or exhausted</li>
<li>You always agree to take on tasks that aren’t yours because you want to avoid conflict</li>
<li>You worry that setting boundaries will make people think you’re selfish</li>
<li>You feel uneasy or restless when you’re not working</li>
<li>You believe your only value depends on how much you do for other people</li>
<li>You stay in a draining job because you don’t want to disappoint anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>These habits usually come from learning, over time, that being helpful keeps you safe or respected. Recovering from codependency means learning to be supportive without losing yourself in the process.</p>
<h3>Being reliable is not the same as being available 24/7</h3>
<p><img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace 3" class="alignright wp-image-57204" height="225" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-4-500x375.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Many people confuse being reliable with being available all the time. But saying yes to everything, always answering messages, and being the one who fixes every problem doesn’t make you reliable; it makes it easy for others to stop respecting your time.</p>
<p>Real reliability means doing what you’ve committed to. It means being clear about your limits and sticking to them. Over-availability leads to confusion. Others may stop considering your time and assume you’ll always adjust to theirs.</p>
<p>Recovering from codependency happens once you start to learn how to be dependable without burning yourself out.</p>
<h3>How Recovery Boosts the Careers of Both the Enabler and Taker</h3>
<p>When someone who tends to over-give in any setting starts to recover, things begin to change. They stop trying to keep everyone happy and start focusing on what really matters. They delegate, speak up, and make choices based on their values instead of guilt. As a result, they feel more confident, and others start treating them with more respect.</p>
<p>Even at work, people who’ve been leaning too much on others also benefit when recovery begins. They start to take more responsibility for their own work and emotions. They learn to handle challenges instead of relying on someone to fix things for them. They grow stronger and become better teammates.</p>
<p>Getting out of the codependency cycle leads to better communication, healthier working relationships, and more balanced teams. It also helps people spot the same patterns in their personal lives.</p>
<h3>10 Steps That Help You Break Free</h3>
<p><strong>Keep track of your yeses</strong> Write down every time you agree to something you didn’t want to do. Review the list each week. You’ll start to notice when and where your boundaries are being ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Use the phrase “Let me get back to you” more</strong> This gives you space to think instead of saying yes right away. It helps you respond with intention rather than guilt or habit.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace" class="alignleft wp-image-57201" height="169" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-500x281.jpg" width="300" />Set working hours, even if you’re remote</strong> Define exactly when you’re available and when you’re not, and let people know. More importantly, stick to it. This helps both you and others respect your time.</p>
<p><strong>Stop saying sorry for having limits</strong> Instead of apologizing when you can’t do something. Replace “Sorry, I can’t” with “Thanks for understanding.” You’re not doing anything wrong by protecting your time and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Pay attention to who drains your energy</strong> Think about which people or situations leave you feeling guilty, anxious, or resentful. These are clues to where codependency may be hiding.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself an important question</strong> Would I still do this if no one noticed? If the answer is no, you may be doing it to please others rather than because it matters to you. You may be acting from a need for approval rather than genuine care.</p>
<p><strong>Start a “done for the day” ritual</strong> Whether it’s closing your laptop, taking a walk, or turning off notifications, mark the end of your workday. Do something that helps you mentally leave work behind.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t take on other people’s emotions</strong> You’re not in charge of how others feel about your boundaries or decisions. Let people have their own reactions without trying to fix them all the time. Emotions are a part of growth and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Get a boundary buddy</strong> Find someone you trust and talk about the goals you’re working on. Check in with each other regularly. Accountability helps you stay grounded.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrate progress</strong> Each time you say no, take a real break, or speak honestly about your needs, acknowledge it. Recovery is built on such small, consistent choices every day.</p>
<h3>When It Might Be Time to Talk to a Professional</h3>
<p>If you try working on all this but still find yourself right back to feeling anxious or guilty when you set a boundary, or if your job feels like your whole identity, it might be time to get some help. A trained therapist or coach can help you understand where these habits come from, how to change them, and how to build something healthier.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace 1" class="alignright wp-image-57202" height="225" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-2-500x375.jpg" width="300" /></strong>You don’t need to hit a breaking point to ask for support. You just need a desire to feel more like yourself again. Recovering from codependency is possible, and you don’t have to figure it out alone.</p>
<p>If you’ve been reading this and recognize yourself as someone who gives too much, avoids conflict, or ties your worth to how useful you are (the enabler), it helps to admit that you want something different.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve been the one content with being spoon-fed and hand-held at work every step of the way (the taker), it’s okay to want something different that allows you to grow independently. Getting free from codependency in the workplace is a way for everyone to start caring for themselves.</p>
<p>If you’d like extra support, reach out to a trained counselor or life coach listed here. Use the contact information listed to schedule a call or appointment. You deserve to enjoy your work without losing yourself in it.</p>
<p>You also deserve support that helps you understand the roots of these patterns so you can build a healthier relationship with your work and with yourself.</p>

<title>Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a teenager reading this, perhaps the idea of counseling has come up in a conversation with your parents, a teacher, or maybe it’s just something that has crossed your mind. The idea of getting things off your chest might sound nice, right? So why the hesitation?</p>
<p>The thought of opening up to someone you don’t even know can feel a little awkward and unnerving. Or maybe you are worried about what others will think. Whatever your hesitation about counseling is, know that it’s okay to feel unsure, but it’s equally okay to take a cautious step forward anyway.</p>
<h3>Is something wrong?</h3>
<p>Just because you go to counseling doesn’t mean that something is wrong with you. In fact, many scholarly minds have argued that mental health counseling is good for everyone, not just those who feel like they need help.</p>
<p>Going to counseling is like going to the gym. Working out helps keep your body strong in the same way that counseling keeps your mind and emotions healthy. Just like a trainer in the gym will teach you how to be safe while exercising, a therapist can help you understand yourself better and equip you with tools to help you succeed in life.</p>
<h3>What Counseling Isn’t</h3>
<p>Therapy and counseling have been depicted in many ways in movies and on television over the years. It’s no wonder that many people have misconceptions about what real-life counseling is like.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens" class="alignleft wp-image-44134" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-500x333.jpg" width="300" />You have probably seen scenes of people lying on a sofa in an office, surrounded by images of Freud and shelves full of fancy psychological books. There’s a mental health professional in the room too, asking personal questions and nodding as someone pours out their deepest darkest thoughts. They say things like, “Hmm,” and “I see” occasionally, analyzing every word. This version of counseling looks intimidating!</p>
<p>Counseling in the real world is much different than how it is popularly represented. It isn’t a sinister tool to force you to spill your whole life to a stranger. It’s not some weird interrogation or a place where you are forced to divulge your most embarrassing moments and innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>When you go to counseling, you won’t be asked to cough up your darkest secret or compelled to dissect your every thought. You don’t have to lie on a couch or look at Rorschach ink blots. Real-life counseling is a lot less intimidating than most people think.</p>
<h3>What happens in a counseling session?</h3>
<p>If counseling isn’t like it’s portrayed in many pop cultural representations, what is a real counseling session like? The truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to counseling. Every counselor has a different style and a different personality, just as your story is unique to you. With that said, there are a few things you can expect at your sessions.</p>
<p>At first, you might spend time getting to know each other. The counselor will probably ask some basic questions to get the conversation started. This will give them an idea of where you’re coming from and what’s going on in your life. They might also ask you what you hope to get from going to counseling sessions.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens 3" class="alignright wp-image-44137" height="169" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-4-500x281.jpg" width="300" />The questions will be basic, especially at first. And even in those moments, you’re never required to talk. You’re in control of what you share and when you’re ready to share it.</p>
<p>The conversation doesn’t have to be one-sided. Ask questions and speak up if you’re uncomfortable. Advocating for yourself or asking clarifying questions not only puts you in charge of the conversation but can give your counselor helpful insights into how your mind thinks and how you process information.</p>
<h3>Why do parents want you to go?</h3>
<p>Your parents (or whoever takes care of you) might be encouraging counseling simply because they care. They want you to have someone safe to talk to, especially if life feels particularly confusing lately. Even when they want to help, sometimes parents just don’t have the right words or tools to communicate.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about how your parents will react to what you discover in counseling, it’s wise to share those concerns with your counselor. A good counselor can help you decide the best ways to communicate with your family.</p>
<h3>What if you don’t trust your counselor?</h3>
<p>Trust issues are real! These can be especially difficult obstacles when it comes to therapy. Unfortunately, counselors and therapists don’t have a magic wand they can wave to make you trust them right up front. Building trust with anyone is a process, so consider it normal if you feel hesitant to open up.</p>
<p>Even in your silence, counselors aren’t offended. Your caution isn’t something new to them, nor does it negate the purpose of going. They are trained to respect your feelings, to keep things confidential, and to create a safe environment for you to truly be yourself.</p>
<h3>What Counseling Can Do for You</h3>
<p>One of the best aspects of going to counseling is that it can help you know yourself better. You might think you are an expert on yourself, and in many ways, you are, but you will likely be surprised at how much you can learn. You might be carrying around emotional scars that you thought were healed. You may even be surprised at how certain thoughts and feelings shape how you see yourself and the world around you.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens 2" class="alignleft wp-image-44136" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Sometimes just talking to a counselor, a professional, unbiased third party, and sharing what’s on your heart and mind – in whatever way feels best to you – can lighten your burden and help you see things more clearly. A counselor or therapist’s role is not to tell you what to do, what to think, or how to feel, but rather to listen and guide you in discovering those things for yourself.</p>
<p>Therapy can also help you build skills. You’ll learn new ways to manage anxiety, cope with anger, improve communication, and build stronger, healthier relationships with family and friends. If you play sports, you know the benefits of having a coach.</p>
<p>A therapist is like a coach for your emotions and your thoughts, helping you learn how to understand and regulate your emotions and how to tame your difficult thoughts. They help you get stronger and more confident, even giving you a playbook for getting through life’s challenges.</p>
<h3>What will your friends think?</h3>
<p>There’s zero shame in seeing a therapist or counselor. More and more young people are turning to counseling these days. It’s actually become quite common. And just to ease your mind, counselors keep what you say confidential, which means that they won’t share your private conversations with others unless you give them permission or if you or someone around you is in danger of being harmed.</p>
<h3>The First Step</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s hard to remember that God cares deeply about every aspect of your life, and that includes your mental health. When you’re going through some of life’s heaviest moments, it’s good to lean on others to help get you through. God didn’t create you to be isolated and alone or to suffer silently.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens 1" class="alignright wp-image-44135" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Counseling can be one of the ways that God works in your life. He often uses people, like counselors, to help you through the rough spots.</p>
<p>Deciding to try counseling is an important first step toward taking control of your mental health. There’s an old saying that reads, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” (Lao Tzu) Deciding to seek counseling is a solid step forward.</p>
<h3>You’re worth it!</h3>
<p>The teen years can be fun, but also full of change, pressure, and lots of challenges. You might feel invisible or unimportant, and it might be easy to believe that your struggles don’t matter much in the larger picture. But you’re not invisible; you are important, and your feelings do matter.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-6 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-5 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-6"><p>The idea of eternal youth is a wildly popular narrative in fictional stories and legends. The legend of the Fountain of Youth, for example, was famously sought out by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. He risked his life looking for a magical spring whose waters could restore youth and vitality to all who would drink it. In <em>Tuck Everlasting</em>, the fountain of youth is such a coveted secret that it creates all types of chaos.</p>
<p>Why are stories like these popular? On some level, most people wish they could retain their youthful energy and good looks forever.</p>
<p>The beauty industry figured out a long time ago that people, particularly women in Western cultures, are willing to part with their hard-earned cash for younger-looking, firmer skin, a youthful glow, and a firmer body. Every year, billions of dollars are spent on creams, serums, supplements, and sculpting tools that promise tighter skin, firmer bodies, and that elusive glow.</p>
<p>When all those creams and potions fail to work, many women have to face the hard, uncomfortable truth that they are aging. That can cause a wide assortment of emotional upheaval, even to the point of depression.</p>
<h3>Is it society’s fault?</h3>
<p>In many ways, society bears much of the responsibility for how women view themselves as they age. The mass media, which both influence and reflect cultural values, often promote the idea that youth equals beauty, which can make it difficult to grow older without confidence and self-doubt. Research says that “as few as 12% of older women are satisfied with their body size.” (Cameron et al, 2019)</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21516" height="300" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sekatsky-K6PnyYNXxRg-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Pick up a fashion magazine and flip through the pages. You’ll see models who have been airbrushed, strategically posed, and photoshopped. Each image is carefully curated and created. The models’ hair, makeup, and clothing are the product of a team of professionals who assure perfection with little regard to reality. The same goes for film, television, and social media messaging.</p>
<p>Western society seems to value beauty and youth above all, frequently neglecting deeper realities and spiritual well-being. At least that’s the message we get. How many overweight and elderly leading ladies can you think of?</p>
<p>Of course, some women have broken the mold and risen to prominence despite unrealistic standards, celebrating their natural, aging bodies. But even those women often face intense pressure to undergo plastic surgery, cosmetic procedures, and airbrushing.</p>
<p>There is such a heavy emphasis on flawlessness that anything outside of this narrow ideal is dismissed or overlooked. With all this emphasis on beauty and youth, it’s no wonder that when women age, they start to feel less valuable, less powerful, and less desirable.</p>
<h3>Is it the body’s fault?</h3>
<p>As a woman ages and menopause kicks in, the body changes. It’s inevitable. With hormone levels changing and metabolism slowing down, skin starts to sag and wrinkle, and body fat becomes increasingly difficult to combat. Aging happens to everyone. And no amount of cream or tonic can change it.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious changes in appearance, there is the body’s natural slowdown. Arthritis may form, or you might develop diabetes. Or maybe your aging body is slower and achier than it used to be. Whatever the case, losing your youthful look and then dealing with related health issues can make women feel hopeless.</p>
<p>Mental health also changes as a person ages. Life stages such as caregiving for elderly parents, dealing with the death of a spouse, watching grown children move out, and other issues that come up after age fifty, can bring on a variety of mental health issues that a woman may not have had to deal with earlier in her life. With the ups and downs of menopause and other health-related issues in the mix, it might be more difficult to deal with life than it was in younger years.</p>
<h3>Everything Changes</h3>
<p>A hard-to-hear truth is that society treats traditionally attractive women differently than it does other groups. Women who fit the mold of traditional beauty are often offered free drinks at the coffeehouse or allowed to cut in line at the amusement park. They may be able to sweet-talk a boss into forgiving them for a transgression with more success than another coworker. It’s all a part of the “pretty privilege” that many young women get to experience.</p>
<p>What happens when this privilege begins to fade? As age creeps in and traditional physical beauty fades, so does this privilege. This can feel like a rug is pulled right out from underneath you. You’re still the same person inside, but the world doesn’t respond to you the way that it used to. And if your identity has been even partially tied to how others perceive you, that loss can be devastating.</p>
<h3>God never changes</h3>
<p>Ready for some good news? Society changes, bodies change, and even your role can change, but the one thing that never changes is God.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21517" height="212" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nickolas-nikolic-eU6cipZuSyM-unsplash-300x212.jpg" width="300" />While the world values outward appearances, God values your heart. He sees beyond wrinkles, stretch marks, and gray hairs. He sees your intention, perseverance, and the soul that He crafted, not only the shell it’s housed in.</p>
<p>Psalm 71 provides words to a prayer that many of us pray as we age. “Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.” (Psalm 71:9, NIV) God promises that He does not abandon us in our old age.</p>
<p>Aging may strip you of some superficial things, but it can also bring about clarity and great reward. As you experience life, you will begin to understand what really matters to you. You can stop chasing what the world values and says you should be and start becoming who God created you to be: a wise, faithful, gentle, bold, and kind woman of God.</p>
<h3>Therapy</h3>
<p>Like legends and stories you grew up hearing, the search for the Fountain of Youth reminds us that lasting youthfulness can’t be found in a magical spring or even an expensive tube of cosmetic cream. Aging is a natural, God-designed cycle of life and something that we should embrace with grace rather than fear.</p>
<p>Still, knowing this is one thing, but embracing aging is another. Depression in aging women is real. The emotional toll of physical changes, role redefinition, and cultural pressure can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Faith-based therapy can provide you with a place to process the grief you feel over your lost youth, identify changes in your body and mind, and help you unload the emotional weight of growing older. It can also provide a supportive environment to explore distorted thoughts or unresolved life experiences that have gone unaddressed.</p>
<p>God may not promise us smooth skin or boundless energy, but He does promise us gifts that are far more valuable and eternal. He offers you purpose, peace, and His companionship. And when you embrace that truth, you will start to shift your thinking about aging.</p>
<h3>The Fountain of Youth</h3>
<p>Your life goal shouldn’t be to stay young forever, but instead to grow older gracefully. Let your natural slowdown be a time to grow in your faith and God’s truth. And as you do, you will become more confident in who you are and in who He is.</p>
<p>The world might try to sell you some anti-aging serum and superficial ideals, but God invites you into something that is far more freeing. He is offering you the chance to live fully, not only in this season, but for eternity.</p>
<p>You might never find that legendary Fountain of Youth, but you can rest assured that you’re not invisible, no matter your age and no matter what the culture tells you. Your beauty is found in a heart inclined toward God.</p>
<p>You don’t have to face this season alone. Together, we can explore the feelings that come with aging and find hope and meaning. Call to learn more.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The idea of eternal youth is a wildly popular narrative in fictional stories and legends. The legend of the Fountain of Youth, for example, was famously sought out by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. He risked his life looking for a magical spring whose waters could restore youth and vitality to all who would drink it. In <em>Tuck Everlasting</em>, the fountain of youth is such a coveted secret that it creates all types of chaos.</p>
<p>Why are stories like these popular? On some level, most people wish they could retain their youthful energy and good looks forever.</p>
<p>The beauty industry figured out a long time ago that people, particularly women in Western cultures, are willing to part with their hard-earned cash for younger-looking, firmer skin, a youthful glow, and a firmer body. Every year, billions of dollars are spent on creams, serums, supplements, and sculpting tools that promise tighter skin, firmer bodies, and that elusive glow.</p>
<p>When all those creams and potions fail to work, many women have to face the hard, uncomfortable truth that they are aging. That can cause a wide assortment of emotional upheaval, even to the point of depression.</p>
<h3>Is it society’s fault?</h3>
<p>In many ways, society bears much of the responsibility for how women view themselves as they age. The mass media, which both influence and reflect cultural values, often promote the idea that youth equals beauty, which can make it difficult to grow older without confidence and self-doubt. Research says that “as few as 12% of older women are satisfied with their body size.” (Cameron et al, 2019)</p>

You’ll see models who have been airbrushed, strategically posed, and photoshopped. Each image is carefully curated and created. The models’ hair, makeup, and clothing are the product of a team of professionals who assure perfection with little regard to reality. The same goes for film, television, and social media messaging.</p>
<p>Western society seems to value beauty and youth above all, frequently neglecting deeper realities and spiritual well-being. At least that’s the message we get. How many overweight and elderly leading ladies can you think of?</p>
<p>Of course, some women have broken the mold and risen to prominence despite unrealistic standards, celebrating their natural, aging bodies. But even those women often face intense pressure to undergo plastic surgery, cosmetic procedures, and airbrushing.</p>
<p>There is such a heavy emphasis on flawlessness that anything outside of this narrow ideal is dismissed or overlooked. With all this emphasis on beauty and youth, it’s no wonder that when women age, they start to feel less valuable, less powerful, and less desirable.</p>
<h3>Is it the body’s fault?</h3>
<p>As a woman ages and menopause kicks in, the body changes. It’s inevitable. With hormone levels changing and metabolism slowing down, skin starts to sag and wrinkle, and body fat becomes increasingly difficult to combat. Aging happens to everyone. And no amount of cream or tonic can change it.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious changes in appearance, there is the body’s natural slowdown. Arthritis may form, or you might develop diabetes. Or maybe your aging body is slower and achier than it used to be. Whatever the case, losing your youthful look and then dealing with related health issues can make women feel hopeless.</p>
<p>Mental health also changes as a person ages. Life stages such as caregiving for elderly parents, dealing with the death of a spouse, watching grown children move out, and other issues that come up after age fifty, can bring on a variety of mental health issues that a woman may not have had to deal with earlier in her life. With the ups and downs of menopause and other health-related issues in the mix, it might be more difficult to deal with life than it was in younger years.</p>
<h3>Everything Changes</h3>
<p>A hard-to-hear truth is that society treats traditionally attractive women differently than it does other groups. Women who fit the mold of traditional beauty are often offered free drinks at the coffeehouse or allowed to cut in line at the amusement park. They may be able to sweet-talk a boss into forgiving them for a transgression with more success than another coworker. It’s all a part of the “pretty privilege” that many young women get to experience.</p>
<p>What happens when this privilege begins to fade? As age creeps in and traditional physical beauty fades, so does this privilege. This can feel like a rug is pulled right out from underneath you. You’re still the same person inside, but the world doesn’t respond to you the way that it used to. And if your identity has been even partially tied to how others perceive you, that loss can be devastating.</p>
<h3>God never changes</h3>
<p>Ready for some good news? Society changes, bodies change, and even your role can change, but the one thing that never changes is God.</p>
<p><img alt="Finding Support for Depression in Aging Women" class="alignright wp-image-44127" height="212" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-support-for-depression-in-aging-women-500x353.jpg" width="300" />While the world values outward appearances, God values your heart. He sees beyond wrinkles, stretch marks, and gray hairs. He sees your intention, perseverance, and the soul that He crafted, not only the shell it’s housed in.</p>
<p>Psalm 71 provides words to a prayer that many of us pray as we age. “Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.” (Psalm 71:9, NIV) God promises that He does not abandon us in our old age.</p>
<p>Aging may strip you of some superficial things, but it can also bring about clarity and great reward. As you experience life, you will begin to understand what really matters to you. You can stop chasing what the world values and says you should be and start becoming who God created you to be: a wise, faithful, gentle, bold, and kind woman of God.</p>
<h3>Therapy</h3>
<p>Like legends and stories you grew up hearing, the search for the Fountain of Youth reminds us that lasting youthfulness can’t be found in a magical spring or even an expensive tube of cosmetic cream. Aging is a natural, God-designed cycle of life and something that we should embrace with grace rather than fear.</p>
<p>Still, knowing this is one thing, but embracing aging is another. Depression in aging women is real. The emotional toll of physical changes, role redefinition, and cultural pressure can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Faith-based therapy can provide you with a place to process the grief you feel over your lost youth, identify changes in your body and mind, and help you unload the emotional weight of growing older. It can also provide a supportive environment to explore distorted thoughts or unresolved life experiences that have gone unaddressed.</p>
<p>God may not promise us smooth skin or boundless energy, but He does promise us gifts that are far more valuable and eternal. He offers you purpose, peace, and His companionship. And when you embrace that truth, you will start to shift your thinking about aging.</p>
<h3>The Fountain of Youth</h3>
<p>Your life goal shouldn’t be to stay young forever, but instead to grow older gracefully. Let your natural slowdown be a time to grow in your faith and God’s truth. And as you do, you will become more confident in who you are and in who He is.</p>
<p>The world might try to sell you some anti-aging serum and superficial ideals, but God invites you into something that is far more freeing. He is offering you the chance to live fully, not only in this season, but for eternity.</p>
<p>You might never find that legendary Fountain of Youth, but you can rest assured that you’re not invisible, no matter your age and no matter what the culture tells you. Your beauty is found in a heart inclined toward God.</p>
<p>You don’t have to face this season alone. Together, we can explore the feelings that come with aging and find hope and meaning. Call to learn more.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The idea of eternal youth is a wildly popular narrative in fictional stories and legends. The legend of the Fountain of Youth, for example, was famously sought out by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. He risked his life looking for a magical spring whose waters could restore youth and vitality to all who would drink it. In <em>Tuck Everlasting</em>, the fountain of youth is such a coveted secret that it creates all types of chaos.</p>
<p>Why are stories like these popular? On some level, most people wish they could retain their youthful energy and good looks forever.</p>
<p>The beauty industry figured out a long time ago that people, particularly women in Western cultures, are willing to part with their hard-earned cash for younger-looking, firmer skin, a youthful glow, and a firmer body. Every year, billions of dollars are spent on creams, serums, supplements, and sculpting tools that promise tighter skin, firmer bodies, and that elusive glow.</p>
<p>When all those creams and potions fail to work, many women have to face the hard, uncomfortable truth that they are aging. That can cause a wide assortment of emotional upheaval, even to the point of depression.</p>
<h3>Is it society’s fault?</h3>

Your relationships may be going amazingly well, meeting your needs and expectations, while also providing you with opportunities to serve others effectively. Healthy and fulfilling relationships such as these are enriching, and they can contribute to an overall sense of well-being.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you might be feeling stuck, struggling to make sense of the state of your relationships, or the conflicts and other challenges you are facing. Relationships that are not in a good space inevitably affect whether you feel okay or whether life is good. One of the factors that could be at play in challenging or unhealthy relationships is having a codependent dynamic.</p>
<p>Knowing the key codependency symptoms can help you identify unhealthy patterns in your life, and it can empower you to take steps to amend things in your relationships.</p>
<h3>Understanding The Heart of Codependency</h3>
<p>There are several ways to think about what codependency is and how it works in a person’s life. It is a set of patterns and a behavioral condition that leads a person to rely too much on others to meet their needs, or to have their sense of identity and approval established. We all rely on each other for certain things, but reliance that is excessive to the point of not being able to function properly without others signals a problem.</p>
<p>Balanced and healthy relationships will have two or more people supporting each other. There’s mutual respect and a good amount of give-and-take that shape their interactions. That is what a good friendship looks like. A co-dependent friendship or relationship instead involves one person sacrificing their well-being to meet another’s need. It often looks like one person always giving of themselves while the other simply takes and takes and takes.</p>
<p>Codependency and a codependent dynamic relationship are not healthy for either party in the relationship, and that will be discussed shortly. Codependent situations will often lead to situations of increasing emotional dependence, enabling behaviors, and an unhealthy dynamic of controlling behaviors.</p>
<p>One way to think of codependency is that the codependent party has a poorly developed sense of self – they can only locate their validation externally, through other people appreciating them and by feeling useful to others. This can leave a person open to emotionally, physically, mentally, and relationally unhealthy and damaging behaviors.</p>
<p>At the heart of codependency is the feeling “I am not enough. I need to always show up and be useful to others before I matter.” They do not have an inherent sense of self-worth and value rooted in simply being one of God’s amazing creatures, made fearfully and wonderfully in His image (Genesis 1:26-28; Psalm 139:14).</p>
<h3>Codependency’s Impact on a Person</h3>
<p>Our actions, patterns, and habits of thought and action all affect us in one way or another. They can affect us negatively or positively. Codependency is a set of patterns and behaviors that typically only result in a negative impact on the codependent person as well as the person who benefits from and enables that codependency.</p>
<p>For one thing, codependency can result in a diminished sense of self. You can never do enough for others to feel okay. There will always be another need, something else that needs fixing or doing, and you will never feel as though you have done enough. The result is a diminished sense of self, along with other challenges such as chronic stress, depression, anxiety, and burnout.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21531" height="200" src="https://millcreekchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty-images-wE-qulzmpe4-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Codependency may also result in feelings of deep resentment toward others. When you make deep personal sacrifices for others without taking time and space for your own needs, and if that is a pattern of behavior, you could wind up feeling resentful toward the people you are doing these things for. They may not be appreciative enough of your sacrifices, or seem to keep needing rescue, which can all sow seeds of resentment.</p>
<p>There can also be emptiness that comes with meeting others’ needs while neglecting your own. You might even feel like you have lost yourself in the quest to always be present for others and prioritize their needs. Your relationships can become imbalanced, and you can end up fostering dysfunction instead of contributing to growth and being a helpful support. If you are always rescuing others, then they are not learning to help themselves and grow.</p>
<p>In the end, codependency does not support the health or well-being of either the codependent individual or the person against whom the behavior is directed.</p>
<h3>Key Symptoms of Codependency</h3>
<p>Given how damaging codependency can be, it heightens the importance of knowing what it looks like, even in seemingly innocent interactions. Some of the key codependency symptoms to be aware of may include the following:</p>
<p><strong>People-Pleasing</strong> This could look like saying ‘Yes’ when you really want to say ‘No.’ A codependent person does this because they crave and is driven by a need for approval from others.</p>
<p><strong>Low Self-Esteem</strong> Feeling like you are not enough, doubting yourself and your value, and carrying feelings of inadequacy.</p>
<p><strong>Poor Boundaries</strong> Akin to people-pleasing, having poor boundaries is about not being able to set and maintain your limits with people. These limits or boundaries may be personal, emotional, or otherwise. They may be about your time and resources, and there are ways to protect yourself and not violate the things that matter to you. Not being able to say no without guilt could suggest codependency.</p>
<p><strong>Being Clingy</strong> Codependent people often have an intense fear of abandonment or rejection. This can result in people being clingy or overly attached to others, even when it is not in their best interest to do so. If you find yourself sticking around long after you were hurt, abused, taken advantage of, or otherwise not treated with the dignity and respect you deserve, codependency may be at the root of it.</p>
<p><strong>Control Issues</strong> Codependency is often accompanied by a need to control people or situations to feel secure. In a codependent relationship, one may feel responsible for others, but that could come with the desire to keep them on a tight leash so that they don’t make as much of a mess, and they don’t have to overextend themselves to sort out those messes. Being controlling is a tell-tale sign of codependency.</p>
<h3>Why Codependency Is Hard to Discern</h3>
<p>The denial that often accompanies codependency is often hard to identify because of other things. If you were taught, whether actively or through life circumstances, that behaving in a codependent way is normal and healthy, then it makes sense that you’d be blind to it. Normalizing codependent behavior as part of family, cultural, or communal norms is one factor why it is so hard to detect.</p>
<p>Another reason codependence can go under the radar is that it can easily be mistaken for virtues such as selflessness, deep love, or loyalty toward others.</p>
<p>For Christians in particular, with Jesus as a role model of sacrifice and servant leadership, it can be easy to mistake a healthy discipleship and life patterned after Jesus, and the dysfunctional patterns of codependency. Codependency, after all, stems from a poorly developed sense of self, not love as Scripture defines it (1 Corinthians 13).</p>
<h3>Overcoming Codependency – Mission Possible!</h3>
<p>Though codependent patterns may be deeply set in an individual, it is possible to overcome and recover from codependency. It is important to discern the signs of codependency, such as feeling drained or being overly responsible for others’ well-being. Learning about healthy relationship dynamics helps. Learning into activities and practices that promote self-worth and healthy autonomy are also steps in the process.</p>
<p>Other helpful steps could also include joining a support group where you can interact with and learn from others with similar experiences. Going for therapy also helps, not only to understand where these codependent patterns come from, but also to learn how to identify them, as well as how to say “No” and set good boundaries for yourself. Individual or family therapy can help reset these patterns and set them on a healthier trajectory.</p>
<p>While it takes time and consistent effort, it is possible to recover from codependence, to grow, learn, and embrace healthy relationships and a godly sense of self-regard.</p>
<p>If this is an issue of concern for you, I will be glad to offer support in a faith-based counseling process.</p>

Your relationships may be going amazingly well, meeting your needs and expectations, while also providing you with opportunities to serve others effectively. Healthy and fulfilling relationships such as these are enriching, and they can contribute to an overall sense of well-being.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you might be feeling stuck, struggling to make sense of the state of your relationships, or the conflicts and other challenges you are facing. Relationships that are not in a good space inevitably affect whether you feel okay or whether life is good. One of the factors that could be at play in challenging or unhealthy relationships is having a codependent dynamic.</p>
<p>Knowing the key codependency symptoms can help you identify unhealthy patterns in your life, and it can empower you to take steps to amend things in your relationships.</p>
<h3>Understanding The Heart of Codependency</h3>
<p>There are several ways to think about what codependency is and how it works in a person’s life. It is a set of patterns and a behavioral condition that leads a person to rely too much on others to meet their needs, or to have their sense of identity and approval established. We all rely on each other for certain things, but reliance that is excessive to the point of not being able to function properly without others signals a problem.</p>
<p>Balanced and healthy relationships will have two or more people supporting each other. There’s mutual respect and a good amount of give-and-take that shape their interactions. That is what a good friendship looks like. A co-dependent friendship or relationship instead involves one person sacrificing their well-being to meet another’s need. It often looks like one person always giving of themselves while the other simply takes and takes and takes.</p>
<p>Codependency and a codependent dynamic relationship are not healthy for either party in the relationship, and that will be discussed shortly. Codependent situations will often lead to situations of increasing emotional dependence, enabling behaviors, and an unhealthy dynamic of controlling behaviors.</p>
<p>One way to think of codependency is that the codependent party has a poorly developed sense of self – they can only locate their validation externally, through other people appreciating them and by feeling useful to others. This can leave a person open to emotionally, physically, mentally, and relationally unhealthy and damaging behaviors.</p>
<p>At the heart of codependency is the feeling “I am not enough. I need to always show up and be useful to others before I matter.” They do not have an inherent sense of self-worth and value rooted in simply being one of God’s amazing creatures, made fearfully and wonderfully in His image (Genesis 1:26-28; Psalm 139:14).</p>
<h3>Codependency’s Impact on a Person</h3>
<p>Our actions, patterns, and habits of thought and action all affect us in one way or another. They can affect us negatively or positively. Codependency is a set of patterns and behaviors that typically only result in a negative impact on the codependent person as well as the person who benefits from and enables that codependency.</p>
<p>For one thing, codependency can result in a diminished sense of self. You can never do enough for others to feel okay. There will always be another need, something else that needs fixing or doing, and you will never feel as though you have done enough. The result is a diminished sense of self, along with other challenges such as chronic stress, depression, anxiety, and burnout.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21510" height="200" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty-images-wE-qulzmpe4-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Codependency may also result in feelings of deep resentment toward others. When you make deep personal sacrifices for others without taking time and space for your own needs, and if that is a pattern of behavior, you could wind up feeling resentful toward the people you are doing these things for. They may not be appreciative enough of your sacrifices, or seem to keep needing rescue, which can all sow seeds of resentment.</p>
<p>There can also be emptiness that comes with meeting others’ needs while neglecting your own. You might even feel like you have lost yourself in the quest to always be present for others and prioritize their needs. Your relationships can become imbalanced, and you can end up fostering dysfunction instead of contributing to growth and being a helpful support. If you are always rescuing others, then they are not learning to help themselves and grow.</p>
<p>In the end, codependency does not support the health or well-being of either the codependent individual or the person against whom the behavior is directed.</p>
<h3>Key Symptoms of Codependency</h3>
<p>Given how damaging codependency can be, it heightens the importance of knowing what it looks like, even in seemingly innocent interactions. Some of the key codependency symptoms to be aware of may include the following:</p>
<p><strong>People-Pleasing</strong> This could look like saying ‘Yes’ when you really want to say ‘No.’ A codependent person does this because they crave and is driven by a need for approval from others.</p>
<p><strong>Low Self-Esteem</strong> Feeling like you are not enough, doubting yourself and your value, and carrying feelings of inadequacy.</p>
<p><strong>Poor Boundaries</strong> Akin to people-pleasing, having poor boundaries is about not being able to set and maintain your limits with people. These limits or boundaries may be personal, emotional, or otherwise. They may be about your time and resources, and there are ways to protect yourself and not violate the things that matter to you. Not being able to say no without guilt could suggest codependency.</p>
<p><strong>Being Clingy</strong> Codependent people often have an intense fear of abandonment or rejection. This can result in people being clingy or overly attached to others, even when it is not in their best interest to do so. If you find yourself sticking around long after you were hurt, abused, taken advantage of, or otherwise not treated with the dignity and respect you deserve, codependency may be at the root of it.</p>
<p><strong>Control Issues</strong> Codependency is often accompanied by a need to control people or situations to feel secure. In a codependent relationship, one may feel responsible for others, but that could come with the desire to keep them on a tight leash so that they don’t make as much of a mess, and they don’t have to overextend themselves to sort out those messes. Being controlling is a tell-tale sign of codependency.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-5 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-4 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-5"><p>An attachment is a close emotional bond between two people. The earliest one, and the one that determines how well you can relate to others later in life, is the emotional bond formed during infancy between you and the parent or primary caregiver. This is the person you were dependent on to meet your most basic needs for comfort, security, and survival.</p>
<p>The nature and quality of that first bond shapes your emotional and social development, self-esteem, capacity for trust, intimacy, and emotional regulation. It also becomes a blueprint that determines your expectations and how you connect with others as an adult.</p>
<h3>What is attachment-based therapy?</h3>
<p>Attachment-based therapy (ABT) is an evidence-based, trauma-informed form of counseling that helps you overcome dysfunctional perceptions and behaviors that stem from early childhood experiences. It is based on attachment theory’s supposition that the experiences you have as you try to bond with your primary caregiver as an infant influence your ability to form and maintain healthy relationships in adulthood, as well as the way you connect with others.</p>
<p>The goal of attachment-based therapy is to help you develop a more secure attachment style and healthier patterns of connecting with others. This happens by exploring and understanding how your early attachment issues are affecting your ability to bond in healthy ways, guide you through the process of healing unresolved emotional wounds, rebuild your ability to trust in others, and learn how to regulate your emotions effectively. The goal is to empower you to form secure, mutually fulfilling relationships going forward.</p>
<h3>What is the origin of attachment theory?</h3>
<p>Attachment theory was originally developed by British psychoanalyst John Bowlby in the 1950s from his work with infants and was expanded on throughout the 1960s and 1970s by Mary Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6290" height="198" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anderson-rian-uIE9f6gV8rI-unsplash-300x198.jpg" width="300" />They found, through their research, that the quality of an infant’s bond with his or her primary caregiver shaped the way he or she handled emotions and formed connections later on. A secure, stable attachment during this vulnerable stage of life is not only crucial to the baby’s survival, but also to his or her ability to develop emotionally in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Infants who do not consistently receive the support, care, and reassurance they need when they are distressed tend to develop feelings of distrust and insecurity that persist into adulthood and lead to an insecure attachment style and an inability to form meaningful bonds.</p>
<h3>What is an attachment style?</h3>
<p>An attachment style refers to your personality and behavioral traits, the way you connect with others, and how you handle intimacy, trust, and emotional closeness as an adult. It is formed in early childhood as a result of the type of bond you have with your mother or primary caregiver and how he or she responds to you when you are feeling distressed.</p>
<p>Psychologists today typically recognize four attachment styles: secure, ambivalent, avoidant, or disorganized. Most people will fit into one of these four categories that will characterize the way they relate to others most of the time</p>
<p><strong>Secure Attachment Style</strong> Key characteristics of a secure attachment style include having good self-esteem, a sense of purpose, being able to trust others and share your needs and feelings openly and honestly and being comfortable with emotional intimacy and independence.</p>
<p>People with this style typically had a secure bond with their caregiver, who was consistently available, nurturing, supportive, and responsive to their needs, and enabled them to feel safe and secure about having someone continually looking out for them.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6291" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/loume-visser-KFtGgduiaN4-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Ambivalent Attachment Style</strong> Also known as an anxious attachment, an ambivalent attachment style is an insecure attachment style in which you crave closeness and reassurance that you are loved but are reluctant to be loved but close to anyone because you have a fear of being abandoned and worry constantly about perceived threats to your relationship.</p>
<p>This style typically develops from inconsistent, unreliable caregiving, where your caregiver was sometimes responsive and sometimes not, leaving you feeling anxious and unsure of what to expect.</p>
<p><strong>Avoidant Attachment Style</strong> Key characteristics of an avoidant attachment style include problems with intimacy and an unwillingness or inability to share your thoughts or feelings with others. You tend to prefer being independent and relying on yourself and may seem emotionally distant and dismissive to others.</p>
<p>This style is typically the result of being consistently rejected, deprived of emotional support, or having your needs frequently dismissed by your caregiver during early childhood, causing you to suppress your emotions to avoid the anticipated rejection.</p>
<p><strong>Disorganized Attachment Style</strong> Key characteristics of a disorganized attachment style include a confusing mix of avoidant and ambivalent behaviors. You feel a strong need for close connections but have trouble trusting others. You are afraid of intimacy, which causes you to fluctuate between being clingy and pushing people away.</p>
<p>This style is typically the result of a frightening, confusing, distressing attachment experience in which the caregiver was sometimes a source of comfort and sometimes a source of fear due to unpredictable, neglectful, or abusive behavior.</p>
<h3>Can attachment styles formed in early childhood be changed?</h3>
<p>Yes, attachment styles and the way you connect with others can be changed. With the help of a licensed mental health professional experienced in attachment-based therapy, you can unpack and address the issues that have led to your current insecure attachment style, learn how to trust others, interact with them in healthy ways, and form and maintain positive, mutually satisfying relationships.</p>
<h3>How does attachment-based therapy work?</h3>
<p>Attachment-based therapy provides a safe space for exploration and recovery. This process allows you to learn, understand, and process the effects of early childhood experiences. These can include neglect, loss, abuse, or inconsistency, and the role they have in the development of your current attachment style and relationship issues. You can then use this knowledge to build more secure relationships in the present.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6292" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sandy-millar-OzyY3C8zVU8-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Because an attachment style is first formed in a relationship, it must also be re-formed in one. Positive change is brought about by creating a secure, trusting relationship with your therapist. This then forms a prototype through which you can practice new ways of relating and interacting with others and become equipped with the necessary skills to break free of the cycle of insecure attachment.</p>
<p>As your trust builds in the therapeutic dynamic, so does your ability to heal and rewrite your story in a way that your past no longer defines your future.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of attachment-based therapy?</h3>
<p><strong>Increased self-awareness and resilience</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps you understand the connection between your early childhood experiences of trying to bond with your primary caregiver and your current relationship patterns and struggles. This paves the way for increased self-awareness and resilience, making it easier for you to recognize what you are feeling and respond with clarity instead of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>Healing from past trauma and relational wounds</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps you heal from past trauma. This is done by guiding you through the process of identifying and processing relational wounds formed during your early childhood attempts to bond with your primary caregiver that are shaping the way you connect with others today.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps you recognize the true source of your current distressing emotions. It brings things back into balance, which has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6293" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/taylor-smith-XB_yndXE4ks-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Improved emotional regulation</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps you develop a sense of security and stability that enhances your ability to manage and regulate your emotions and express them in healthy ways.</p>
<p><strong>Greater self-esteem</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps build your confidence and self-worth, reshape your perception of yourself, and treat yourself with greater care and compassion, as it makes you aware that dysfunctional patterns of behavior are not flaws, but rather, adaptations learned to protect yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Greater independence and genuineness</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps ground you and enables you to feel greater inner security. This allows you to be more genuine by showing you how to set healthy boundaries without feeling guilty, speak up without fear, and connect with others without losing yourself in the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Healthier, more fulfilling relationships</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps you form and maintain healthier, more fulfilling relationships with others. It makes you aware of dysfunctional emotional patterns and equips you with the skills you need to overcome them.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced communication skills</strong> Attachment-based therapy helps increase your ability to handle conflict and emotional challenges more effectively. You can improve your communication skills and learn how to express your needs in healthier ways.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-8 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-7 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-8"><p>The health of your relationships plays a large role in your well-being. We are relational and social beings, created to love God and others. We are most human when we are in nurturing relationships with others who help bring out our God-given potential, and when we do the same for them. Healthy relationships give us accountability, stability, and support during troubled times, as well as an environment to flourish in.</p>
<p>If relationships are that influential, it makes sense that when they go awry, the negative impact needs to be felt deeply and in a variety of ways. Broken or unhealthy relationships damage your well-being, introducing stress, disharmony, and unpleasant emotions that can be hard to live with. One way for the health of your relationships to get eroded is through codependence.</p>
<h3>The Damage Done by Codependent Behavior</h3>
<p>Codependency can be described as a behavior displayed by a person with a poorly formed sense of self, who relies on others for their identity, emotional well-being, or sense of validation. Codependency may, at first, look like deep devotion to someone, but its roots are in something that is decidedly unhealthy.</p>
<p>A codependent person is overly reliant on others for their sense of self. They feel valuable, worthwhile, and purposeful only when they are expending themselves for others. Their source of validation is external to themselves, and this can result in a constant feeling of unsettledness unless they are doing something for others that allows them to feel needed. That is a hard place to be.</p>
<p>Codependent behavior is often masked by unwavering support of a loved one who cannot seem to become organized, or a selfless love that is eager to swoop in for the rescue at every opportunity. However, it can silently erode the health of the relationship and the well-being of all individuals involved in that dynamic. Getting to grips with the damage that codependency causes is a good step toward undermining it.</p>
<p>Codependency can lead to issues such as emotional exhaustion. Making yourself available and trying to meet others’ needs consistently often comes with a tradeoff – your own well-being. What often happens with codependence is that one’s needs get neglected. You put yourself out so much that you end up experiencing burnout, anxiety, and depression from the constant outpouring of yourself.</p>
<p>Another damaging result of codependency is that it can stunt the personal growth of the individuals caught in the relationship. Both parties can become trapped in roles that stop them from growing mentally, socially, emotionally, spiritually, and in other ways. If someone is always bailing you out, you will not learn to handle your own crises. If you are constantly helping others out past your limits, that hinders your well-being.</p>
<p>Often, codependence also results in distorted relationship patterns. Being overly involved in another’s life can edge past being helpful toward being controlling or manipulative. These, along with enabling unhealthy behaviors to retain the feeling of usefulness, can all potentially lead to broken trust and the loss of genuine connection with one another.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is possible that codependency can result in usurping the role of Christ. If you are over-reliant on someone to meet your needs, you can subtly and possibly overtly put them in Christ’s place, relying on them for your strength and identity. If you are expending yourself for others, there is also the possibility of feeling like it’s up to you to save people from themselves and not rely on Christ to be their savior and help.</p>
<h3>Why It is so Hard to Step Away from Codependence</h3>
<p>It is a valid question to ask why, if a person becomes aware of a codependent dynamic in their relationship, they do not simply step away. Why stay in such a relationship and perpetuate such a dynamic? There are several reasons people stay in such relationships, even when they become aware that these patterns are deeply damaging to them and others.</p>
<p>Breaking free from codependent patterns in relationships is challenging due to the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>A Fear of Abandonment</strong> Often, childhood experiences are the root cause of codependency. If one grew up in a situation where they felt valued only as they served the needs of others, their experience could shape a deep desire to be needed and a fear of being rejected if they don’t attend to the needs of others. Hence, one can become trapped by fear and the belief that stepping away from these patterns will result in rejection or loneliness.</p>
<p><strong>Misplaced Identity</strong> If a person finds their self-worth solely from doing things for others in order to get the sense of feeling needed, it could be a hard habit to shake. Without knowing how else to be, it can simply be a case of doing what you feel familiar with, even when the familiar is not helpful or healthy. Finding a new identity can be hard and disorienting.</p>
<p><strong>Feelings of Guilt and Shame</strong> One of the side effects of codependency is that you can overextend yourself, but doing so feels natural and the right thing to do. When you feel responsible for another person’s happiness, one unintended result is that it can create overwhelming guilt when attempting to set boundaries. You can feel like you are letting people down or hurting them.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21498" height="200" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vlad-tchompalov-8-bZnMIAz-c-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Cultural or Familial Conditioning</strong> Codependency is often normalized through learned behaviors from family dynamics or societal expectations. It is possible even for spiritual communities to foster the idea that saying “No” and having boundaries is unspiritual, selfish, or ungodly. Just as changing your identity is hard, it can be difficult to go against the culture or communities that helped form and support you.</p>
<p>It can be hard to step away from codependent behaviors because others may encourage them, they may seem normal, and you may also feel internal pressure to continue with those behaviors because they have become part of who you are. Changing courses can be hard, but it is not an impossible task.</p>
<h3>Taking Steps Toward Healthier Relationship Patterns</h3>
<p>Codependency can be damaging, and the patterns may be hard to break. It can be a struggle to break free, but it is important to pursue the path toward healing and developing relationships that reflect God’s design. There are steps you can take as you do this, and these include the following:</p>
<p>Take the time to reflect and consider the following. Do you have any relationships in your life where you feel overly responsible for another person’s emotions or decisions? If you do, there may be codependent dynamics at work. You can also look out for other signs of codependency, including feeling like you cannot say “No,” experiencing emotional and physical burnout because of neglecting your needs, or being resentful toward others.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge codependent tendencies in your life and to understand where these tendencies come from. What stories are you telling yourself to maintain these tendencies? Take the time for introspection and journaling to better understand those tendencies in yourself.</p>
<p>You can also seek the Lord’s guidance. Not only can you seek His will for your life and relationships in Scripture, but you can also consider how Scripture encourages you to find your identity and worth in Christ alone. Look to the Lord for your sense of self-worth. Consider also how you can seek the Lord in the process of establishing healthier boundaries.</p>
<p>Speaking of setting healthy boundaries, you must learn how to say “No” without guilt. We all have limits; you need to respect yourself and help others respect them as well, just as you respect them. We need healthy boundaries for the sake of mutual respect and to nurture our well-being.</p>
<p>You can also cultivate healthy relationships with people who honor your boundaries and encourage your personal and spiritual growth. Relationships are meant to be marked by healthy and mutual interdependence, and that should be what you aim for. Your friends and loved ones should encourage a mindset that your worth is rooted in being a child of God, not in fulfilling others’ expectations.</p>
<p>Walking with a Christian counselor can help you in various ways. It can provide you with the biblical insights and the tools you need to work through the complexities of codependency. Counseling can help you understand how codependency distorts relationships and help you unpack where these patterns came from in your life.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-8 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-7 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-8"><p>The health of your relationships plays a large role in your well-being. We are relational and social beings, created to love God and others. We are most human when we are in nurturing relationships with others who help bring out our God-given potential, and when we do the same for them. Healthy relationships give us accountability, stability, and support during troubled times, as well as an environment to flourish in.</p>
<p>If relationships are that influential, it makes sense that when they go awry, the negative impact needs to be felt deeply and in a variety of ways. Broken or unhealthy relationships damage your well-being, introducing stress, disharmony, and unpleasant emotions that can be hard to live with. One way for the health of your relationships to get eroded is through codependence.</p>
<h3>The Damage Done by Codependent Behavior</h3>
<p>Codependency can be described as a behavior displayed by a person with a poorly formed sense of self, who relies on others for their identity, emotional well-being, or sense of validation. Codependency may, at first, look like deep devotion to someone, but its roots are in something that is decidedly unhealthy.</p>
<p>A codependent person is overly reliant on others for their sense of self. They feel valuable, worthwhile, and purposeful only when they are expending themselves for others. Their source of validation is external to themselves, and this can result in a constant feeling of unsettledness unless they are doing something for others that allows them to feel needed. That is a hard place to be.</p>
<p>Codependent behavior is often masked by unwavering support of a loved one who cannot seem to become organized, or a selfless love that is eager to swoop in for the rescue at every opportunity. However, it can silently erode the health of the relationship and the well-being of all individuals involved in that dynamic. Getting to grips with the damage that codependency causes is a good step toward undermining it.</p>
<p>Codependency can lead to issues such as emotional exhaustion. Making yourself available and trying to meet others’ needs consistently often comes with a tradeoff – your own well-being. What often happens with codependence is that one’s needs get neglected. You put yourself out so much that you end up experiencing burnout, anxiety, and depression from the constant outpouring of yourself.</p>
<p>Another damaging result of codependency is that it can stunt the personal growth of the individuals caught in the relationship. Both parties can become trapped in roles that stop them from growing mentally, socially, emotionally, spiritually, and in other ways. If someone is always bailing you out, you will not learn to handle your own crises. If you are constantly helping others out past your limits, that hinders your well-being.</p>
<p>Often, codependence also results in distorted relationship patterns. Being overly involved in another’s life can edge past being helpful toward being controlling or manipulative. These, along with enabling unhealthy behaviors to retain the feeling of usefulness, can all potentially lead to broken trust and the loss of genuine connection with one another.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is possible that codependency can result in usurping the role of Christ. If you are over-reliant on someone to meet your needs, you can subtly and possibly overtly put them in Christ’s place, relying on them for your strength and identity. If you are expending yourself for others, there is also the possibility of feeling like it’s up to you to save people from themselves and not rely on Christ to be their savior and help.</p>
<h3>Why It is so Hard to Step Away from Codependence</h3>
<p>It is a valid question to ask why, if a person becomes aware of a codependent dynamic in their relationship, they do not simply step away. Why stay in such a relationship and perpetuate such a dynamic? There are several reasons people stay in such relationships, even when they become aware that these patterns are deeply damaging to them and others.</p>
<p>Breaking free from codependent patterns in relationships is challenging due to the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>A Fear of Abandonment</strong> Often, childhood experiences are the root cause of codependency. If one grew up in a situation where they felt valued only as they served the needs of others, their experience could shape a deep desire to be needed and a fear of being rejected if they don’t attend to the needs of others. Hence, one can become trapped by fear and the belief that stepping away from these patterns will result in rejection or loneliness.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-21520 alignleft" height="200" src="https://millcreekchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vlad-tchompalov-8-bZnMIAz-c-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Misplaced Identity</strong> If a person finds their self-worth solely from doing things for others in order to get the sense of feeling needed, it could be a hard habit to shake. Without knowing how else to be, it can simply be a case of doing what you feel familiar with, even when the familiar is not helpful or healthy. Finding a new identity can be hard and disorienting.</p>
<p><strong>Feelings of Guilt and Shame</strong> One of the side effects of codependency is that you can overextend yourself, but doing so feels natural and the right thing to do. When you feel responsible for another person’s happiness, one unintended result is that it can create overwhelming guilt when attempting to set boundaries. You can feel like you are letting people down or hurting them.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural or Familial Conditioning</strong> Codependency is often normalized through learned behaviors from family dynamics or societal expectations. It is possible even for spiritual communities to foster the idea that saying “No” and having boundaries is unspiritual, selfish, or ungodly. Just as changing your identity is hard, it can be difficult to go against the culture or communities that helped form and support you.</p>
<p>It can be hard to step away from codependent behaviors because others may encourage them, they may seem normal, and you may also feel internal pressure to continue with those behaviors because they have become part of who you are. Changing courses can be hard, but it is not an impossible task.</p>

<p>Codependency can be damaging, and the patterns may be hard to break. It can be a struggle to break free, but it is important to pursue the path toward healing and developing relationships that reflect God’s design. There are steps you can take as you do this, and these include the following:</p>

<title>Social Media and Teens: Feeling Left Out</title>
<link>https://orangecountychristiancounseling.com/articles/social-media-and-teens-feeling-left-out</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">https://orangecountychristiancounseling.com/?p=32106</guid>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Even those living under the proverbial rock have an online profile these days, so it’s not surprising that most teens want to fit in by joining all kinds of social media. After all, today’s teens were practically born with their usernames on their birth certificates.</p>
<p>Many modern parents don’t object to their children participating in the digital world because they themselves have spent much of their lives sharing on social media. But just because something is familiar doesn’t mean it’s safe, especially for those who haven’t even graduated high school yet.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some positive aspects of social media, like keeping in touch with distant friends; however, there are pitfalls too, and one of the biggest pitfalls of social media use among teens is that it can make them feel left out of their social group or society in general. The idea of “social” media is to be social, but the unfortunate byproduct of sociability is that someone is often left out. And even more difficult, that someone might be your teen.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard of FOMO or the fear of missing out. Social media can often exacerbate this fear. Your teen suddenly has a front-row seat to observe their classmates’ and work associates’ private lives. They can see firsthand the images of the birthday party they weren’t invited to and the group photo they aren’t in. They have access to threads with inside jokes they aren’t a part of and romances they don’t have.</p>
<p><img alt="Social Media and Teens: Feeling Left Out" class="alignleft wp-image-32107" height="200" src="https://orangecountychristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/social-media-and-teens-feeling-left-out-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Even the strongest, most grounded kid can feel the sting of being excluded. Social media shines a light on every instance where they “don’t belong,” and that consistent evidence of exclusion can make them feel like they are always on the outside looking in, even if they were just with those same friends yesterday.</p>
<p>Teens might not only feel left out of their personal social circles because of what they see on social media, but they can also feel disconnected from society in general. If they measure their successes by the distorted measuring stick of social media, they feel left out of or disconnected from the general population of their peers.</p>
<p>If they see their favorite influencer transform into a movie-star quality version of themselves with nothing more than a new skincare routine and a ring light, teens might start to wonder why their lives don’t look like that and what might be missing from their own lives that leaves them short of that type of perfection.</p>
<p>The more time teens spend scrolling, rather than connecting face-to-face with their peers, the more they lose sight of their authentic relationships, the truth, and what really matters. That’s why it’s imperative to closely monitor your child’s involvement in social media. Ground your teens in the truth that God made them to belong to His family, and that’s the only belonging that really matters.</p>
<p>If your teen has been damaged by social media, Christian therapy can help. A faith-based counselor can walk with them through the hurt of exclusion, the weight of false expectation, and the confusion to help them find out where they really fit in. No matter how left out your teen feels, they’re never out of God’s reach.</p>
<p>To learn more about how Christian therapy can help your child use social media without feeling left out, contact our office today.</p>

<title>Death Anxiety: What is Thanatophobia?</title>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-9 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-8 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-9"><p>It is no secret that death is inevitable. We will all face death. But for some people, there is a fear of death that can cause anxiety. For these people, the thought of death is distressing and consuming. This death anxiety is also known as thanatophobia.</p>
<p>This type of anxiety can also lead to issues with mental health and daily functioning. Some people may fear the dying process as well as dying. It is important to note that thanatophobia is not the same as necrophobia, which is the fear of dead or dying people or things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.” – </em><strong>John 14:1-3, NIV</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What Does Death Anxiety Feel Like?</h3>
<p>Phobias are types of anxiety disorders. They are based on a fear that causes a person to struggle with everyday living. When this fear interrupts life, it becomes a diagnosable phobia. Death anxiety can cause an individual to stop engaging in the things they once enjoyed. It’s not specifically listed in the manual of mental disorders, but death anxiety is thought of as a specific phobia.</p>
<p>There are criteria used to help determine if there is a true phobia. Once the symptoms are identified, they are compared to the criteria.</p>
<p>Symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Racing heart</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
<li>Excessive worry or fear of death or dying that gets in the way of life</li>
</ul>
<p>Criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The above symptoms last more than 6 months</li>
<li>The symptoms interfere with everyday life</li>
<li>The person will avoid situations involving death</li>
<li>The symptoms become noticeable when death is brought up in conversations</li>
<li>The symptoms cause a person to avoid any situation regarding death</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes of Death Anxiety</h3>
<p>There is no specific list of causes for death anxiety. It is thought that most people develop this phobia in their childhood or early teen years. It could be a combination of stress, trauma, and genetics. Some of the factors that can play a part in the struggle with death anxiety are:</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21469" height="200" src="https://everettchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Death-Anxiety-What-is-Thanatophobia-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Abuse history </strong>Some people may develop this phobia because they have been abused sexually, physically, and/or mentally.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Public health crisis </strong>When a pandemic such as COVID, AIDS, or the flu arises, a person may develop a phobia because of the many deaths that occur.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma </strong>Personal trauma that may involve a near-death experience can create a fear of death or dying.</p>
<p><strong>Environment </strong>A child who has been raised in an environment of anxiety, overprotection, or criticism is at risk for phobias, including death anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Chronic illness </strong>A person who is diagnosed with a chronic or terminal illness may find themselves struggling with the symptoms of death anxiety.</p>
<h3>Overcoming Death Anxiety</h3>
<p>Understanding how to manage the symptoms of death anxiety begins with the knowledge that death is a natural experience. Knowing values and expectations of life can be the biggest factor in overcoming the fear of death. A person who understands why they have death anxiety is more likely to find a way to overcome the struggle. Another step for overcoming thanatophobia is to identify any habits that may feed the fear of death.</p>
<p>It’s okay to fear death, but it’s not okay to live in that fear. Changing the thoughts of death that cause anxiety can create a new thought process that reduces anxiety and fear. A Christian counselor can help you navigate the healing process so you can begin to enjoy life as God intended.</p>

<title>Dating Advice for Men: The Importance of Integrity in Dating Relationships</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>There is no shortage of content on social media about dating and relationships. Every other YouTube Short, TikTok or Instagram story, or post on X has something seemingly definitive to say about romantic relationships between men and women. The sheer volume of content and the confidence of the content creators can be more confusing than helpful when trying to navigate dating.</p>
<p>The thing about dating is that there isn’t a consensus or agreed-upon set of rules that everyone is trying to follow. It really is something of the wild west in the dating world, and each person is pursuing their own goals and trying to secure their own piece of happiness. The situation is rife with selfishness, and it’s hard to be vulnerable and honest because you could be taken advantage of by someone with less scruples than you.</p>
<p>As you wade out into the dating pool, you need to ask yourself who you are, and what you want from your relationships. The fact is, your resolve is going to be tested, whether through disappointments, betrayals, mind games, or setbacks. In the end, dating can really be a test of faith; it can challenge what you believe about humanity, and it will require you to look beyond your circumstances to a deeper goal.</p>
<h3>What Integrity in Dating Might Look Like</h3>
<p>When you’re out there trying to date people, you have a variety of choices about how you’ll do that. Not only can you try to meet people online or through dating apps, but you can also meet people in person and build connections that way. Beyond how you meet people, there is the question of how you put yourself out there, and how you present yourself to others.</p>
<p>You could choose, for instance, to lie about yourself to be more attractive to others. This ranges from outright untruths about your interests, achievements, past, and personality, to shading the truth and concealing realities about yourself.</p>
<p><img alt="Dating Advice for Men: The Importance of Integrity in Dating Relationships 1" class="alignleft wp-image-32846" height="225" src="https://cachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dating-advice-for-men-the-importance-of-integrity-in-dating-relationships-2-500x375.jpg" width="300" />This could be done by using a filter on your photos or using an old photo where you looked your best, or it could mean using a photo with you posed next to a friend’s Lamborghini, creating the impression it’s yours.</p>
<p>Other ways of putting yourself out there include going all out on the first date and doing the most so that you secure a second and third date. This could mean wearing clothes that aren’t yours to boost your chances or blowing up your budget to go places that aren’t your usual haunts.</p>
<p>All this is common when dating – people play a part, masking parts of themselves and highlighting other things to give themselves the best chance at finding love.</p>
<p>Integrity is about being honest with others and yourself about who you are, despite the push or pull of your circumstances to act otherwise. When you operate out of integrity, you commit yourself to being truthful and to live without hypocrisy. This doesn’t mean that you’re a perfect person, but it does mean that you are sincere and willing to own up to your flaws.</p>
<p>In dating, integrity might mean putting what your real interests are on your dating profile and taking a girl to the places you typically eat, as opposed to what might impress her. Putting integrity front and center in dating means being vulnerable enough to share what you truly feel and think about a variety of subjects, and not simply taking the path of least resistance by being overly agreeable.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Integrity in Dating</h3>
<p>There are many ways for a person to create a false or misleading impression about themselves, and many reasons for it. Some would say it’s part of the dating game, that no one is entirely honest about who they are, and this is the way to make the best first impression.</p>
<p>The importance of integrity in dating comes through in several ways, which include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mismatched expectations and disappointment</strong> One frustrating aspect of dating is when two people aren’t upfront about what they want from the relationship. Mismatched expectations can lead to disappointment and frustration with one another and the dating process itself. If you lie about who you are, the truth coming out can cause significant hurt.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability and connection</strong> If you approach dating with integrity, it creates room for vulnerability and genuine connection. You’re not hiding behind a façade or creating a false impression that will crumble under closer inspection. Any connection you make is more likely to be real if you’ve been honest about who you are from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Peace of mind</strong> It can be exhausting playing the mind games that often come with modern dating. Playing it straight and with integrity allows you to have peace of mind. When you know yourself and your limits, you can protect yourself and assert your boundaries where necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approaching dating with integrity isn’t necessarily easy. You need wisdom to know how to be appropriately vulnerable with someone you just met so you don’t expose yourself to unnecessary hurt.</p>
<p>Dating with integrity will also require you to be confident about who you are, and that you have intrinsic value that can’t be diminished by another person.</p>
<p>Dating has its fair share of challenges, and you can find help to navigate these with a counselor. Individual counseling can help you develop your communication skills, nurture your self-confidence, and cultivate your emotional resilience. You can learn to accept yourself and appreciate your worth.</p>
<p>Reach out to our office to schedule an appointment with a counselor who can help you process your dating journey.</p>

Are you and your daughter enjoying one another? We are deeply relational and social beings, which is why the state of our relationships has such an overwhelming impact on our well-being. Even if other areas of our lives are going well, if our closest relationships are in disarray, it’s likely that we won’t feel happy or fulfilled.</p>
<p>The quality of our relationships holds the key. If your gifts and personhood are valued, your individuality is honored, your excesses are held to account, and you can love and be loved, you will have a positive well-being. If, on the other hand, your relationships are marked by conflict, abuse, and other unhealthy behaviors, then it’s likely your overall welfare will be negatively affected.</p>
<p>The parent-child relationship is one of the most crucial. Whether you are a biological or adoptive parent, you have the opportunity to shape your child positively. You have the power to help them develop fruitful habits of thought, which will impact their long-term ability to form healthy relationships with others. That is why it is so important for mothers and daughters to relate to one another in a life-giving way.</p>
<h3>Toxic Mother-Daughter Dynamics</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6279" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/guille-pozzi-y1wVavuxZtE-unsplash-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Sadly, like everything else in a broken world, life doesn’t always work the way God intended it to. A relationship between a mother and daughter can, in fact, be toxic, doing the opposite of what it was meant to. Instead of providing space for nurture, encouragement, and support, the connection can unravel in several unhealthy ways.</p>
<p>A relationship is toxic if it is unhealthy for one or both. There are countless ways that the toxicity manifests. If you recognize the described dynamics in your own relationship with your mother or your daughter, work is needed to restore and heal the relationship.</p>
<p>Some toxic dynamics in a mother-daughter relationship may include:</p>
<p><strong>Constant criticism</strong> – A mother criticizing her daughter’s choices, of career, clothing, or partners, can wear on the relationship. Likewise, if a daughter constantly disregards her mother’s choices or values, she is eroding the bond between them. If the only time they refrain from criticism is when expectations are met, obedience is clear, or permission is given, then the relationship is conditional. This is not the goal.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of support</strong> – No matter how old one gets, it is essential to know that their key people will have their back. In struggle, new ventures, loss, or mental health challenges, everyone needs to feel their people are with them.</p>
<p>Having the support of loved ones can make a world of difference in accomplishing goals and overcoming obstacles. If the mother-daughter relationship is toxic, there will likely be constant criticism and little support to strengthen it along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Being put down</strong> – Being criticized is one thing, but when the parent or the child puts the other down, it is a clear sign of toxicity. Lobbing insults, dredging up past failures, or making jokes at the expense of the other person has a long-lasting impact. This hurt and humiliation may be with intent, or it may just be the way the family talks to one another. Either way, it is harmful and unproductive.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6280" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jonatas-domingos-QrU1apBxO5M-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Living vicariously</strong> – Sometimes parents view their child as a second chance at life. Having a child can give you an opportunity to right past wrongs, to break unhealthy family dynamics and habits, and to give them what you wish you’d been given by your own parents. However, this can also go sideways, as a mother can try to live the life she wanted through her child.</p>
<p>There are many stereotypes, for instance, of the out-of-control pageant mom, who forces her child to enter contests, to diet, and so on. All of it is in pursuit of her own lost dreams. Parents often do try to live vicariously through their children, but they should never compel or manipulate their children into relationships, careers, and other situations to satisfy themselves. They should let their child have their own dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Reversal of roles</strong> – Sometimes a role reversal takes place because of age, disability, or mental health conditions. The child becomes the parent, and the parent becomes like a child. Now, the child has to persuade their parent to go to their doctor’s appointments, to take their medication, and so on. This happens often because, as people get older, they get set in their ways, become forgetful, or feel a loss of control.</p>
<p>Another insidious form of role reversal occurs when care-taking shifts because of poor self-management, addiction, immaturity, and poor choices. A mother with codependent tendencies creates a toxic role reversal that is detrimental.</p>
<p>A daughter left to care for her mom after another bad breakup is unfair. When her child must be the one warning her about a destructive boyfriend or must lock up her possessions to keep her mother from stealing to feed an addiction, toxicity is marking the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Being embarrassed</strong> – It’s not uncommon for an adolescent to find their parents embarrassing. As one gets older, that shifts into a deeper understanding and appreciation. Past that adolescent phase, however, if the mother-daughter relationship is characterized by feelings of embarrassment and not wanting to be with each other, that may be a cause for concern.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6281" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/j-w-E8cenvOOpHQ-unsplash-scaled-1-217x300.jpg" width="217" />Poor boundaries</strong> – Boundaries keep a relationship healthy. These can be violated in several ways, including a mother depending on her daughter for everything or attempting to micromanage her daughter’s life. Likewise, intrusive behaviors such as barging into one’s room or house unannounced or reading someone’s private journal are indications that the relationship is unwell.</p>
<p><strong>Unavailability</strong> – Being emotionally available is about being open to the expression of emotion from others and showing them affection. A mother-daughter relationship characterized by withdrawing when emotions are expressed or by withholding love is dysfunctional.</p>
<p><strong>Gaslighting and manipulation</strong> – Gaslighting is when one person makes another doubt their perceptions of reality, their memory, or their judgment. It’s a way of maintaining control and manipulating someone to rely on the person gaslighting. This may include denying what someone is feeling, or making someone believe something is true when it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Being passive-aggressive</strong> – Another way to exercise control over another person is to use anger. Anger can be explosive, making people walk on eggshells to avoid triggering it. However, anger can be passive-aggressive. When someone gives the silent treatment, makes snide remarks, snorts, dismisses what is said, or interrupts speaking, they can silence and manipulate others.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling behaviors</strong> – Whether creating and enforcing an exacting schedule, inspiring anger through gaslighting, or using tears to manipulate someone into acting in desired ways, controlling behaviors are toxic. Parents want what is best for their children and are often right in guiding their children away from danger. However, that guidance shouldn’t be manipulative or motivated by a fear of losing control.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6282" height="225" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bence-halmosi-0eErMhzFgvE-unsplash-300x225.jpg" width="300" />Abusive</strong> – A mother-daughter relationship that is marked by abuse, whether emotional, verbal, or physical abuse and neglect, is a toxic one. The relationship is meant to be safe and nurturing.</p>
<p>Whatever setting or context you grow up in, your experience is likely to seem normal. Perhaps it’s only when you see how other people interact with their children or parents that it becomes evident that perhaps your situation isn’t what it could or should be. There is hope to begin healing a damaged mother-daughter relationship and to address the toxic dynamics that drive the relationship.</p>
<h3>Healing for a Broken Mother-Daughter Relationship</h3>
<p>If any of these traits look familiar, know that you do not need to fix the situation alone. A professional counselor can help guide you through the process. A broken relationship can see healing, especially if both parties realize that it needs mending. If you each recognize the hurt you caused one another, you can both learn to love each other well.</p>

Call our offices today, and we can set up an appointment with a qualified therapist to assist you in pursuing your healing.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In one of His interactions with His disciples, Jesus offered support to the disciples through the impending crisis of His death at the hands of the Roman authorities. He gave them this analogy for what they would experience:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. So also, you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. – <strong>John 16:20-22, ESV</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus was pointing out what mothers typically experience when it comes to childbirth – there is sorrow, pain, and deep anguish. This is usually then followed by joy because the miracle of birth and the new human being who is welcomed. While this experience is indeed typical for many mothers, it’s also true that the experience of childbirth can be quite traumatic for several reasons.</p>
<h3>Traumatic Childbirth Experiences</h3>
<p>The experience of childbirth can be a joyful and beautiful time, but it can also be a time of deep anguish too. Expectations is one of the reasons why many women struggle to process the trauma of childbirth. When these expectations don’t materialize or feel out of sync with one’s actual experiences, that can result in feelings of guilt, self-blame, or self-doubt.</p>
<p>Childbirth can be traumatic. One way to understand trauma is to define it as when a person experiences stressful, frightening, or distressing events that are out of one’s control or difficult for them to cope with. Some traumatic childbirth experiences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having to undergo an unplanned caesarean section due to complications</li>
<li>Going through a difficult labor that might be accompanied by a long and painful delivery</li>
<li>A health emergency arising as a result of the birth process (for mom or baby)</li>
<li>Experiencing some other shocking or unexpected things during birth, such as an unexpected diagnosis</li>
<li>Feeling unsupported, uncared for, afraid or helpless during the childbirth process</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences can result in what is known as postnatal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a type of anxiety disorder.</p>
<h3>The Challenges that a Traumatic Childbirth Brings</h3>
<img alt="Finding Healing After A Traumatic Birthing Experience" class="alignleft wp-image-35861" height="200" src="https://redmondchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/finding-healing-after-a-traumatic-birthing-experience-500x333.jpg" width="300" />When a person has PTSD, they may relive the experience in which they felt out of control, helpless, or in danger. This can result in vivid flashbacks of the event, as well as nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and intense distress at symbols or reminders of the trauma. One might feel unsafe and find it hard to trust others. This can make it difficult to look after your child, especially if the symptoms are severe.</p>
<p>A traumatic childbirth can lead to many complications after the birth, which can negatively affect your relationship with your baby. Women who have experienced trauma during childbirth may feel helplessness, fear, or shock about their experience and suffer from flashbacks, recurrent thoughts, overwhelming memories, and nightmares about the birth.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s not uncommon for them to feel distressed or anxious when they are exposed to things which remind them of the traumatic event. This may lead them to trying to avoid anything that reminds them of the trauma, which can include talking about it, seeing birth depicted on a TV show, or being in a hospital.</p>
<p>When a woman who’s experienced a traumatic childbirth has flashbacks or recurring thoughts, the memories feel less like memories and more like it’s actually happening, and they are still in imminent danger. This in turn triggers physical reactions such as panic attacks. These experiences can affect a woman’s relationship with herself, and also with the people around her.</p>
<h3>Addressing a Traumatic Childbirth Experience</h3>
<p>Traumatic childbirth experiences can be addressed and overcome. Likely the main obstacle for many women is that they may feel uncomfortable speaking openly about what they have undergone for fear of being seen as a failure as a mother, or for coming across as being ungrateful for their new child. However, it’s important to talk about these experiences with a mental health professional, especially if they are affecting your ability to care for yourself and your baby.</p>
<p>Using talk therapy techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), you can begin to process your experiences so that you can better cope with what’s happened. Additionally, medications may be helpful to address symptoms associated with PTSD and depression, which often go hand in hand.</p>
<h3>Help is a Phone Call Away</h3>
<p>If you or a loved one have undergone a traumatic childbirth experience, it’s important to seek out help and support to begin the journey toward healing and wholeness. A counselor can guide you in therapies meant to repair that which was traumatized. Reach out to our offices today so that we can connect you with a skilled therapist who is ready to help you on your journey.</p>

<title>Learning to Trust After Trauma: Spotting People’s Green Flags</title>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-7 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-6 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-7"><p>Many of us know what it feels like to have been traumatized by a toxic relationship, whether it was romantic, platonic, or professional. It might have been an overly critical partner, a bullying boss, or a manipulative best friend who caused emotional damage, leaving us with low self-esteem and trust issues. Even if it’s hard, moving past this can help.</p>
<p>It’s important to move on for the sake of your love life, social life, or career, but it’s also common to feel wary of others after being so negatively impacted by someone. It takes time and practice to learn to trust again after trauma, but there will be safe people who will help the healing process. It all starts with learning to recognize the green flags, or positive signs that someone is trustworthy and wholesome.</p>
<h3>Cycles, Spirals, and Choices</h3>
<p>“Once bitten, twice shy,” as our parents used to say about any impactful experience. It’s human nature to shrink back from danger and preserve peace and sanity. Still, some people seem to run headlong into danger and toxic relationships.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6267" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zosia-szopka-hhmsHlJrUEs-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />There are hundreds of reasons why we allow awful people into our lives, and still more reasons why we stay in harmful situations, some of them quite complex. We don’t live our lives by being perfect and getting everything right. We live them by having all kinds of experiences and learning from them.</p>
<p>Maybe the first step in our healing process needs to be learning to practice non-judgment. Some people get caught in a spiral where they consistently make bad choices because they don’t feel worthy of the benefits of a healthy one.</p>
<p>The toxic relationships they involve themselves in reinforce their opinions and beliefs about themselves, ensuring that they will never make a healthy choice. Such a person does not need to hear judgments and disapproval. They need to become aware of their true value and worth.</p>
<p>Nothing cripples us quite as effectively as guilt, shame, and fear. Even when we were victimized and traumatized by harmful, toxic people, many of us carry guilt and shame as if we were the ones to blame. There is a difference between acknowledging where we should have made a better choice and continuing to carry the blame for something that was never our fault.</p>
<p>Growth and healing are about looking back, learning, and breaking cycles and spirals with healthier choices. It can take years of practice to learn to do this, but what counts is that we are living, learning, and being kinder to ourselves.</p>
<h3>Spotting People’s Green Flags</h3>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6268" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gabriel-ponton-5iHQcsit55Y-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" /></strong>It’s often the case that the safest, healthiest people to spend time with are not the ones who make the biggest first impression. They might not be the most charming, best-looking, or most charismatic person. They might be older than most of our other friends, or even married, ruling out the possibility of a future relationship.</p>
<p>Being a more non-judgmental person extends to not ruling others out based on shallow criteria. A safe person might be entirely different from anyone you have been friends with before, but maybe that is exactly what you need.</p>
<p>There is no particular list of assets when looking for someone to trust again. It is different from the dating site culture, where you swipe left or right based on a short list of shallow points. Safe people make you feel something you don’t ordinarily feel, and they do it naturally, without having to manipulate the situation. Here are some identifiers of people who are likely safe to trust and become close to:</p>
<p><strong>You feel calm around them</strong></p>
<p>Some people simply radiate peace, calm, and positive vibes. They are unrattled, not easily stressed, but most of all, they have no expectations of you. You might feel calm around them because of their peaceful nature, but it also might be that they have no interest in policing you, controlling you, or manipulating you. You feel emotionally regulated around them, even though they often have no idea that is the case.</p>
<p><strong>You can be yourself around them without fear of being judged</strong></p>
<p>The safest people are usually the ones who see you and accept you as you are. You might be fragile, emotionally tender, and defensive around them as you nurse wounds from a previous traumatic experience.</p>
<p>They will see this and accept it, knowing that sometimes people need the time, space, and patience to heal. It might be an entirely new concept for you, but the freedom and release that comes from being seen and not judged is a deep part of healing from trauma.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6269" height="200" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/natalia-blauth-ZVVHNdrkscg-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />They move at a pace you are comfortable with</strong></p>
<p>Whether this person is a coworker, a love interest, or a new friend, you will know that they are safe because they let you set the pace of the connection. Safe people might show interest, but it won’t feel like prying. They might encourage you, but it won’t feel controlling. They might invite you out, but they won’t sulk if you decline.</p>
<p>You might realize that you have been calling the shots and setting the pace in the relationship without even realizing it, but that is no mistake on their part. They intentionally let you take the lead out of respect for you.</p>
<p><strong>You let your guard down around them to the point of being fun and even silly</strong></p>
<p>One of the most healing aspects of connecting with safe people is that we rediscover joy. When we’re around toxic people or in traumatizing situations, we become focused on survival, and there is no space for us to enjoy anything. We might wear a kind of emotional armor to avoid the toxic darts of criticism, or the poisoned arrows of shame.</p>
<p>In contrast, safety means relaxing, dropping the heavy burdens, and enjoying the small things. Sometimes we literally have to shake off the negative effects of past trauma and celebrate with the person who makes us feel safe and joyful again.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6270" height="300" src="https://vancouverchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-kC74PFXK8ic-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" />You can express your opinions, preferences, and truths around them</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common things to be targeted in a toxic relationship is our boundaries. Harmful people tend to step all over our boundaries, even taking delight in destroying them. Our voice, preferences, opinions, and truths are all ignored or picked apart for sport. If a red flag is how silenced we feel, a green flag is how comfortable and easy it is to make ourselves heard with someone. A safe person will value our opinions, preferences, and honesty.</p>
<p><strong>Their feedback and critiques do not feel harsh or judgmental</strong></p>
<p>Any kind of relationship is made up of give and take. In the same way that it is a green flag for someone to take your opinion or feedback on board, it is also a good sign if they can offer their opinion, feedback, and even critique. If they are safe, this will not feel alarming and will not cause you to feel ashamed, which might be a new experience for you. They are safe if they are honest in a sensitive way.</p>
<p><strong>You feel comfortable sharing your highs, lows, and mids with them</strong></p>
<p>That armor we wear around harmful people extends to our faces. In toxic relationships, we often mask our emotions and hide our experiences. Safe people make us drop our guards, cast away our emotional armor, and learn to share from our personal experiences again. They see us on our good, bad, and mediocre days, and there is healing in being able to be honest around them.</p>
<h3>Breaking the Cycle: Christian Counseling in Vancouver, WA</h3>
<p>If you have left a toxic relationship, you have begun a process of healing already. May it continue as you carefully choose who to open up to and who to avoid. Significant healing occurs in private as you reflect on your memories and choices, but an important part of healing happens when you let someone into your life again. Love is patient, kind, and non-judgmental. If you find it, hold onto it so that you may let go of shame, guilt, and fear.</p>
<p>It’s not always easy to find safe people, but a good place to start is with a Christian counselor in Vancouver, Washington. Counselors build their careers on confidentiality, kindness, and patience. If you would like to meet with a Christian counselor in Vancouver, Washington, please contact us, and we can help.</p>

<title>Common Signs of Mental Illness</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>You know when things do not feel right, but is it mental illness? Something seems off, but maybe you cannot put your finger on it. Are your emotions all over the place? Have you been having angry outbursts? Are your actions aggressive?</p>
<p>There used to be a stigma behind mental disorders. But as more people seek therapy, talking about the signs of mental illness is more common. Knowing what to look for in yourself and others can help you seek treatment options earlier.</p>
<h3>Common Signs of Mental Illness</h3>
<p>You will notice that many common signs of mental illness are the same in several classes of mental disorders. Therefore, it takes time for a licensed professional to assess and diagnose a condition. Therapists use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, by the American Psychiatric Association to diagnose a condition and take into consideration how long and how often your symptoms persist.</p>
<p>Below is a list of common mental disorders and their symptoms.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Common Signs of Mental Illness 1" class="alignleft wp-image-32762" height="200" src="https://lachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/common-signs-of-mental-illness-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</strong></p>
<p>Doctors typically diagnose ADHD during childhood. Although some adults are diagnosed later in life, mainly it is because their parents never spoke to a doctor about their symptoms or believed it was just the child “being a kid.”</p>
<p>Symptoms of ADHD can include hyperactivity, but it is not mandatory for a diagnosis. Most children have a problem with fidgeting as they try to focus on something. The lack of focus and inability to concentrate are symptoms that mark ADHD.</p>
<p>Children with ADHD are also impulsive and can engage in risky behaviors. For example, they tend to be impatient and have trouble waiting their turn. This behavior can lead to problems with their peers, as well as anxiety and depression.</p>
<p><strong>Bipolar Disorder</strong></p>
<p>Bipolar disorder appears as an extreme state of emotions and behaviors. On one end of the spectrum, the person with bipolar disorder will go through a depressive state. In depression, they may sleep more, eat too much or too little, gain weight rapidly, and have fatigue. Getting out of bed in the morning is challenging. They tend to isolate themselves and lose interest in their favorite hobbies.</p>
<p>However, during a manic episode, the person has mood swings and experiences a state of euphoria. These highs can lead to insomnia, hurried speech, and quick movements. They may forget to eat and lose weight. Manic episodes can lead to risky behaviors and a heightened sex drive. Both the manic and depressive states can last weeks or months.</p>
<p><strong>Anxiety Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety disorders are born from fear and worry. These concerns interfere with the person’s daily activities, job, and relationships. Anxiety symptoms include rapid heart rate, excessive sweating, shortness of breath, chest tightness, panicky feelings, feelings of impending doom, feelings of hopelessness, and irritability.</p>
<p>In addition, the anxious person may be overcome with worry about their family, home, job, finances, or other things that prevent them from taking chances or being able to relax.</p>
<p>Anxiety and stress typically go hand in hand, although researchers are unclear if underlying fear brings about stress or if stress makes a person anxious. Therefore, it is a good idea to try to lower your stress levels to reduce anxiety and prevent panic attacks. Anxiety disorders include OCD and PTSD, two different mental disorders with severe anxiety as the link.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Common Signs of Mental Illness" class="alignright wp-image-32761" height="300" src="https://lachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/common-signs-of-mental-illness-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Dementia</strong></p>
<p>Dementia is not really a mental illness; however, it interferes with brain function and lowers a person’s quality of life. The condition affects memory but creates a cascade of physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. For example, a person with dementia can become depressed, paranoid, or have hallucinations as his or her cognitive function declines.</p>
<p>A person with dementia can become more confused, especially in the evenings. Confusion can cause him or her to wander off and get lost. Speech problems and mood swings are common symptoms of dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Depression</strong></p>
<p>Depression affects millions of people each year in the U.S. Depression is a sadness that will not seem to lift. People with depression may feel fatigued, sleep too much or have trouble falling asleep, eat too much or too little, have rapid weight changes, and isolate themselves.</p>
<p>You might forget things or have trouble concentrating, especially on work projects or school assignments. You may lose interest in activities you enjoy, which can cause problems in your relationships. Depression feels like a heavy cloud has taken residence on your chest and refuses to go away.</p>
<p>Depression brings irritability, anger, and mood swings. In addition, you may have unwanted thoughts that can lead to self-harm or suicide. If you suspect you have depression or suicidal thoughts, reach out to someone today.</p>
<p><strong>Eating Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Eating disorders are considered mental health conditions because each one boils down to obsessive thoughts about weight and appearance, leading to compulsive action. For people with anorexia nervosa, this can mean fearing the weight gain severely enough to starve themselves.</p>
<p>People with bulimia purge food after consumption before the body has a chance to digest it. Typically, this is through vomiting, laxatives, enemas, or overexercising. Anorexia and bulimia are deadly if left untreated.</p>
<p>Binge eating is another eating disorder, but it does not have starving or purging behaviors, although some people may hold off eating all day and binge in the evening. A binge is an uncontrollable behavior where the person eats thousands of calories worth of food over a short time, usually two hours.</p>
<p>People with binge disorder may be unaware of what they are eating and cannot sense when their stomach is full until after the binge. As a result, binge eaters eat past their comfort zone until it is painful. This behavior leads to obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol levels, Type II diabetes, and more.</p>

<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a mental illness with obsessive and intrusive thoughts that spur compulsive behaviors. For example, someone with OCD may worry about the safety of their loved ones and themselves, so he or she checks and rechecks all the locks on the windows and doors each night. He or she may get out of bed in the night to recheck.</p>
<p>OCD has several categories of behavioral patterns, including cleaning and contamination (germaphobia), checking, ordering and symmetry, intrusive thoughts about harming others, and hoarding. The behaviors interfere with the person’s life and can take time out of his or her day. He or she will continue in the pattern until he or she learns to break the cycle between thoughts, emotions, and compulsive behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</strong></p>
<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is an anxiety disorder that can develop after experiencing trauma. The trauma can be from various sources, such as being under fire during a war, living through a natural disaster or tragic accident, or surviving a mass shooting. The condition can also emerge from long-term stress, such as domestic abuse.</p>
<p>PTSD symptoms can come on quickly in a person confronted with a trigger. He or she may physically back away from the source, experience nightmares, and have panic attacks. Some people with PTSD lash out at others or turn down a destructive path. Anxiety and depression are common with PTSD.</p>
<p><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></p>
<p>Schizophrenia is one of the most widely recognized psychotic disorders. The signs of mental illness for this condition involve breaking from reality. With schizophrenia, the person can no longer distinguish between reality and imagination. As a result, his or her thoughts and speech become distorted. In addition, he or she may experience hallucinations and delusions.</p>
<p>People with schizophrenia may behave compulsively, have mood swings, and suffer from anxiety or anger. They believe things that are not true in our reality, which terrifies them and their loved ones, as they may harm themselves. Psychotic disorders require treatment from a licensed mental health care practitioner.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-10 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row fusion-flex-align-items-flex-start fusion-flex-content-wrap"><div class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-9 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-flex-column"><div class="fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-justify-content-flex-start fusion-content-layout-column"><div class="fusion-text fusion-text-10"><p>Whether you are starting a new relationship with someone who was betrayed by their previous partner, or whether you are trying to rebuild a relationship after infidelity, there are certain things every betrayed person needs to heal.</p>
<p>Recovering from infidelity is a long and complicated process where some days your partner will feel better, and other days they won’t be able to see a way past their pain. All in all, it can take between three and five years for someone to fully heal from betrayal trauma. Healing after infidelity doesn’t happen without significant, consistent, intentional effort on your part, and a willingness to risk again on theirs.</p>
<h3>The Aftermath of Betrayal</h3>
<p>Betrayal changes everything in a relationship, regardless of the situation that led to it. The timeline of every relationship is split in two when there has been admitted betrayal. There is everything that happened before the affair, which may or may not have been ideal, but will always feel like the better or simpler time. Then there is everything after.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25769" height="200" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-mFAiQcSbkgs-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Now the betrayed partner looks at everything through the lens of what happened after they discovered the truth. As far as they are concerned, most betrayed partners will feel like everything has changed.</p>
<p>Some relationships feel stable, healthy, and drama-free. Affairs and betrayal sting all the more for the wronged partners in these instances. It feels like their entire world and perception of safety and goodness was just shattered by a wrecking ball that came out of nowhere. It’s not unlike surviving an unforeseen apocalyptic event that changes the world. They emerge from the wreckage to evaluate the damage, finding that even doing that is an overwhelming task.</p>
<p>Sometimes affairs happen on the back of tension, uncertainty, and emotional distance in a relationship. Some affairs are not sexual or physical in any way, and yet they still break the boundaries of a relationship, hurting your partner and changing your relationship with them. Regardless of the nature of the affair, the result is the same: one partner made a choice, and the other partner was hurt by that choice, whether intentionally or not.</p>
<p>Sometimes, all that remains after infidelity is the rubble of a ruined relationship, and the cost to repair it outweighs the time and effort it will take to do so. If your partner is willing to move forward and is trying to rebuild after a betrayal, it pays to know some things as you move forward together.</p>
<h3>Things To Avoid Saying and Doing After Infidelity</h3>
<p>When wounded by an unjust situation like infidelity, some people tend to hold onto the wound and brood over it, unwilling to forgive and let it go. They might feel morally superior to their cheating partner and relish the feeling they get from being on the high ground in the relationship.</p>
<p>If you attempt to rationalize their behavior or accuse them of anything like cruelty or bitterness, you will likely only cause more harm and damage. Avoid being defensive, sarcastic, or fighting fire with fire.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-25770" height="169" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/renee-thompson-n5ceic89p2k-unsplash-300x169.jpg" width="300" />Avoid telling them to “let it go” or suggesting that they simply try to move on. Most people in these situations would love to do just that, but it’s not so simple. Similarly, when you say things like, “Nothing happened” or “It was meaningless,” you are minimizing their experience and reducing the quality of the relationship you built together.</p>
<p>The infidelity wasn’t <em>nothing</em> because they were clearly hurt by the event. And saying “it was meaningless” is the same as saying your relationship was meaningless, seeing as you hurt your partner by doing something you considered trivial.</p>
<p>Lastly, avoid trying to spread or share the blame. Implying that you only cheated because of something your partner did or didn’t do is not fair because they didn’t choose to violate the boundaries of the relationship. Infidelity is a choice, even when you regret it afterward.</p>
<h3>The Things Every Partner Needs After Infidelity</h3>
<p>Rebuilding a relationship after infidelity is difficult, but not impossible. If an affair is the earthquake that turns a relationship into rubble, then the rebuilding will be a long process of intentional actions, clearing rubble and placing one brick carefully upon another.</p>
<p>One of the most important things you can do for your partner in the rebuilding process is to consider what they need for the relationship to be mended. Every person is unique, but here are some of the most common things partners need after infidelity:</p>
<p><strong>To have their emotions acknowledged and validated</strong></p>
<p>Betrayal trauma is complex. It often triggers other similar traumas, like abandonment issues, grief over having to let go of certain dreams and hopes, and issues around low self-esteem. If you were the party that caused the harm, it might be difficult to constantly admit to your fault, but this issue is no longer about you. Healing comes when you pay attention to, take note of, and validate their emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Patience with the process</strong></p>
<p>Anyone dealing with the aftermath of an affair will go through a messy process of anger, fear, doubt, and a host of other deep emotions. Healing is never a linear process, and there will be some days that are better than others. Your partner needs you to show up without being asked to. Trust is earned back little by little through steady, measurable acts of devotion.</p>
<p><strong>Actions that match words</strong></p>
<p>The best thing you can do for your partner as they’re healing from betrayal is to be consistent with your commitments. Prove to them that you are trustworthy by following through on your promises. If you feel like you can’t commit to something, don’t promise it.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25771" height="200" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kelly-sikkema-530092-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Open and honest communication</strong></p>
<p>Healthy relationships thrive on a balanced mix of openness and personal space. Ordinarily, it would be perfectly okay to keep some thoughts and feelings to yourself. However, after infidelity, even the smallest amount of reserve can feel like secrecy or even dishonesty.</p>
<p>Partners who are healing from betrayal trauma need an extra level of openness and honesty that would be overkill in other circumstances. You need to eliminate any doubt by overcommunicating and being more open than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Gentleness and warmth</strong></p>
<p>They aren’t choosing to stay in emotional turmoil. Even when they want to let go of past events and move on to a new beginning in the relationship, chances are their nervous system is keeping them in a state of lockdown for their own safety. Mentally, they might be longing to rekindle the physical relationship, or simply show you that they still love you, but it’s as if they are frozen.</p>
<p>This response is a natural defense mechanism, and there is nothing you can do to bypass it, except to prove that you are not a threat. Be patient, don’t push or challenge them, and practice being warm and gentle as a default, especially during confrontations or emotionally charged conversations.</p>
<h3>Moving Forward After Infidelity</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-25772" height="188" src="https://bothellcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/marek-studzinski-VSk-s2HfZ2s-unsplash-300x188.jpg" width="300" />There is a future for each partner in a relationship affected by infidelity, although it might not look like what you expected. Whether you ultimately end up starting over with someone new or try to salvage a home out of the wreckage, life does not end with betrayal.</p>
<p>It might be the hardest chapter of your lives, and you might see the worst of each other for a few seasons, but it is possible to heal things and emerge as a stronger, more empathetic person than you were before. There is hope after infidelity, but it takes effort, intentionality, and honesty.</p>
<p>You may be the one who made bad choices that impacted your relationship, or you may have been on the receiving end of those choices. Either way, you might feel stuck, broken, and in need of support. Counseling could help you get unstuck and see where and how to move forward. Counselors offer empathetic, non-judgmental support and a much-needed perspective on the situation. Contact us if you would like to explore counseling as a next step.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Clinical depression affects more than 21 million people in the United States annually. The mental condition is also referred to as Major Depressive Disorder. When an individual experiences the symptoms of clinical depression consistently for more than two weeks, a mental health professional may diagnose them with the mental disorder.</p>
<h3>Common Clinical Depression Symptoms</h3>
<p>Clinical depression symptoms interfere with daily activities, including pleasurable hobbies, as well as relationships and goals. Depression can feel like a dark cloud following you around. You might find it difficult to resume daily responsibilities. Autopilot becomes your way to get through the day, and for many, getting out of bed feels like too much effort.</p>
<p>The following are some clinical depression symptoms you may experience:</p>
<p><strong>Persistent sadness – </strong>Sadness that hangs on for two weeks or more and interferes with daily activities. You may not be able to identify why you feel sad or empty. You may feel numbness to things around you.</p>
<p><strong>Fatigue – </strong>A bone-weary tiredness that leaves you with little energy to do anything. You might sit on the couch or lie in bed. The fatigue makes it so you only do the things you absolutely have no choice but to do.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep problems – </strong>Trouble falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much can leave you groggy in the morning. The brain needs time to recover and repair during the night, and sleep deprivation can lead to higher levels of the stress hormone, cortisol.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of interest – </strong>Losing the joy and pleasure you once had for favorite activities. This can include hobbies, activities, events, movies, music, work, or school. You may find it draining to socialize even with the people you love most in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in appetite – </strong>Depression not only affects stress hormones, but it also alters the hormones responsible for hunger and metabolism. Ghrelin and leptin signal when you are hungry and need to eat, and when you are full or satisfied and need to stop. You may find that you are not hungry much at all or that you overeat as a coping mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid weight gain or loss – </strong>Due to changes in appetite and hormones, you may see a rapid weight gain or loss. If you overeat and suffer from fatigue, the scale may go up, and your clothes might fit tighter. However, if you barely eat and suffer from sleep deprivation, relying on caffeine to keep you going, you may lose a considerable amount of weight.</p>
<p><strong>Trouble concentrating – </strong>Trouble concentrating or focusing on tasks due to depression is common. With the lack of motivation and the increased fatigue, it can be hard to recall important details or complete work projects. You may leave projects half done or frequently lose items.</p>
<p><strong>Mood swings – </strong>Irritability, anger, and mood swings can also develop with depression. You feel as if you shouldn’t be bothered by others, and little things may make you angry. You might snap at your family or coworkers more often or have an outburst of anger and cry when you least expect it.</p>
<p><strong>Feeling guilty, ashamed, or worthless – </strong>The empty feeling from depression can also leave you with feelings of guilt, shame, regret, and worthlessness. You might feel that no matter what you do, nothing gets better. Depression robs you of joy, but the mental condition is not permanent, and it is treatable. You are more than these emotions.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Managing Clinical Depression Symptoms" class="alignleft wp-image-6877" height="200" src="https://spokanechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/managing-clinical-depression-symptoms-310x207.jpg" width="300" />Headaches and unexplained body aches – </strong>Headaches and body aches can worsen depression symptoms, but depression alters brain chemistry and pain perception. You may experience more frequent, unexplained aches and pains. This can make you feel worse. Consult with your counselor and physician about pain management combined with therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Suicidal ideations – </strong>Negative thoughts, intense emotions, and impulses can lead you to self-harm or suicidal ideations. Talk therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy could help alleviate depression symptoms and help you challenge negative thoughts.</p>
<p>If you are having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming others, seek help immediately.</p>
<h3>How to Manage Symptoms</h3>
<p>The symptoms of depression can affect physical and emotional health. Learning to make small changes and instill new, healthier habits can help relieve symptoms when combined with therapy. In some cases, your physician may recommend medication. Your mental health care plan should be well-rounded.</p>
<p>The following is a list of things you can do to manage symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking Professional Help</strong></p>
<p>A professional mental health provider can diagnose clinical depression and create a plan to manage and overcome the symptoms. Seek professional help if you experience symptoms consistently for more than two weeks or have thoughts of self-harm or suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Better Quality Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Prioritizing sleep by creating a nightly routine and going to bed earlier can help your brain recover and repair. Sleeping seven to nine hours nightly can lower adrenaline and cortisol levels, stress hormones that, when high, can worsen depression and anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing Stress</strong></p>
<p>You can reduce stress further by slowing down. Whether that is practicing deep breathing or moving into stretching poses, slowing down releases tension. Try a physical relaxation technique known as Progressive Muscle Relaxation to learn how to identify areas of tension in the body. Lie down on a bed or the floor, and starting with the toes, systematically tense body parts for a few seconds and then release. Move through the body, tensing and relaxing. Breathe deeply during each round.</p>
<p><strong>Exercising Daily</strong></p>
<p>Exercise is God’s way of giving us a little mood boost throughout the day. It also improves physical health. The brain releases serotonin, dopamine, and other chemicals that naturally lower stress hormones and leave you feeling happier, more confident, and accomplished. A brisk 30-minute walk in the morning, most days of the week, could help you feel more relaxed and happier. For physical benefits, aim for 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity movement weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding Ultra-Processed Foods</strong></p>
<p>Ultra-processed foods, foods and beverages with added chemicals, sugars, and preservatives, can worsen depression symptoms. These types of food alter bacteria in the gut, which is correlated with brain function. Aim for healthier foods, such as lean proteins, healthy fats, fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Limiting Alcohol</strong></p>
<p>Alcohol can trigger depression in some people and worsen symptoms. People may overdrink to cope with uncomfortable or painful emotions. Alcohol may make them feel better temporarily by numbing those emotions. However, the individual feels worse after the alcohol wears off and eventually will need to consume more alcohol to get that same feeling.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for someone struggling with alcoholism and depression to start drinking with a can or two of beer or glasses of wine and find themselves years later drinking a case of beer or a bottle of wine before bed to gain the same effect. If you struggle with alcohol, reach out for help.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking Help for Substance Abuse</strong></p>
<p>Much like alcohol, substances like illegal drugs and prescription drugs can alter brain chemistry and worsen depression and anxiety. Abusing prescription drugs or taking illegal “street” drugs will require professional help to stop and manage withdrawal symptoms in a safe environment, whether that is at home with supervision or under a doctor’s care in a facility.</p>
<p>As with alcohol, the brain builds a tolerance to drugs, and it takes more to receive the same effect. Giving the body time to detox and receive nourishment in the form of healthy foods and physical activity can alleviate the severity of some depression symptoms.</p>
<h3>Help for Clinical Depression Symptoms</h3>
<p>Don’t struggle with clinical depression symptoms another day. Reach out to our center to schedule a session with a Christian counselor. Depression is a common but challenging mental health disorder that requires therapy and lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>We offer help by connecting you to a counselor for an assessment. Afterward, you and your counselor create a customized care plan to manage clinical depression symptoms so you can move forward. Give us a call today.</p>

<h3>The Things Every Partner Needs After Infidelity</h3>
<p>Rebuilding a relationship after infidelity is difficult, but not impossible. If an affair is the earthquake that turns a relationship into rubble, then the rebuilding will be a long process of intentional actions, clearing rubble and placing one brick carefully upon another.</p>
<p>One of the most important things you can do for your partner in the rebuilding process is to consider what they need for the relationship to be mended. Every person is unique, but here are some of the most common things partners need after infidelity:</p>
<p><strong>To have their emotions acknowledged and validated</strong></p>
<p>Betrayal trauma is complex. It often triggers other similar traumas, like abandonment issues, grief over having to let go of certain dreams and hopes, and issues around low self-esteem. If you were the party that caused the harm, it might be difficult to constantly admit to your fault, but this issue is no longer about you. Healing comes when you pay attention to, take note of, and validate their emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Patience with the process</strong></p>
<p>Anyone dealing with the aftermath of an affair will go through a messy process of anger, fear, doubt, and a host of other deep emotions. Healing is never a linear process, and there will be some days that are better than others. Your partner needs you to show up without being asked to. Trust is earned back little by little through steady, measurable acts of devotion.</p>
<p><strong>Actions that match words</strong></p>
<p>The best thing you can do for your partner as they’re healing from betrayal is to be consistent with your commitments. Prove to them that you are trustworthy by following through on your promises. If you feel like you can’t commit to something, don’t promise it.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21399" height="200" src="https://millcreekchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kelly-sikkema-530092-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Open and honest communication</strong></p>
<p>Healthy relationships thrive on a balanced mix of openness and personal space. Ordinarily, it would be perfectly okay to keep some thoughts and feelings to yourself. However, after infidelity, even the smallest amount of reserve can feel like secrecy or even dishonesty.</p>
<p>Partners who are healing from betrayal trauma need an extra level of openness and honesty that would be overkill in other circumstances. You need to eliminate any doubt by overcommunicating and being more open than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Gentleness and warmth</strong></p>
<p>They aren’t choosing to stay in emotional turmoil. Even when they want to let go of past events and move on to a new beginning in the relationship, chances are their nervous system is keeping them in a state of lockdown for their own safety. Mentally, they might be longing to rekindle the physical relationship, or simply show you that they still love you, but it’s as if they are frozen.</p>
<p>This response is a natural defense mechanism, and there is nothing you can do to bypass it, except to prove that you are not a threat. Be patient, don’t push or challenge them, and practice being warm and gentle as a default, especially during confrontations or emotionally charged conversations.</p>
<h3>Moving Forward After Infidelity</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21400" height="188" src="https://millcreekchristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/marek-studzinski-VSk-s2HfZ2s-unsplash-300x188.jpg" width="300" />There is a future for each partner in a relationship affected by infidelity, although it might not look like what you expected. Whether you ultimately end up starting over with someone new or try to salvage a home out of the wreckage, life does not end with betrayal.</p>
<p>It might be the hardest chapter of your lives, and you might see the worst of each other for a few seasons, but it is possible to heal things and emerge as a stronger, more empathetic person than you were before. There is hope after infidelity, but it takes effort, intentionality, and honesty.</p>
<p>You may be the one who made bad choices that impacted your relationship, or you may have been on the receiving end of those choices. Either way, you might feel stuck, broken, and in need of support. Counseling could help you get unstuck and see where and how to move forward. Counselors offer empathetic, non-judgmental support and a much-needed perspective on the situation. Contact us if you would like to explore counseling as a next step.</p>
