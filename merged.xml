<description><![CDATA[<p>Being agreeable sounds like a good thing, right? In fact, as a child, you were probably told to “just get along” with your siblings or to “just go with the flow” during family vacation. Being agreeable can be a good thing and often appears to be humility and love, but for people pleasers, the motive isn’t love at all; it’s fear.</p>
<p>People pleasers don’t want to upset anyone, so they say “yes” to everything. They go along with the group plans even when they are uncomfortable. They apologize even when they’ve done nothing wrong. Underneath all those yeses and sorries is often the quiet belief that if they keep everyone happy, they’ll be liked and admired.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that isn’t usually the case. The opposite is often true. Fear-based kindness is a breeding ground for unhealthy, toxic relationships.</p>
<p>The Scripture even warns about trying to please people. In Proverbs 29:25, it says, “The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe.” Fear of people’s disapproval creates a trap. It pulls you into relationships that are one-sided and manipulative. Sadly, it invites the very thing you were trying to avoid, like rejection, disrespect, and emotional fatigue.</p>
<h3>Toxic people are drawn to people pleasers</h3>
<p>Manipulators are drawn to people who don’t push back against their aggression. They are drawn to people who over-apologize and who want to keep the peace so badly that they tolerate anything, even being disrespected.</p>
<p>To a toxic person, a passive people-pleaser appears to be the ideal friend. They love to attach themselves to someone who will offer them no resistance, confrontation, or challenge. And what the people-pleaser themselves see as “easygoing” is an open invitation to toxic people for misuse.</p>
<h3>The Message People Pleasing Conveys</h3>
<p>Saying “Whatever you want” repeatedly sounds harmless, even cooperative, but it communicates a negative message. It is telling the other person in your life that your voice doesn’t matter, that they get to decide everything, and that their needs come before your own. It teaches others to stop asking for your input and to assume that you really don’t care.</p>
<p>Eventually, people stop seeing you as a whole person with needs and preferences of your own. You are reduced to the role of helper, fixer, and emotional support person, but not a person with equality. People pleasing keeps you in quiet frustration and blinds everyone else to your needs.</p>
<h3>Even Jesus had boundaries</h3>
<p>If people pleasing seems like a virtue to you, consider Jesus’ stance on the topic.</p>
<p>He was compassionate and served others wholly and perfectly. He wept with those who grieved and loved the unlovable. But what He didn’t do was to cater to them. He didn’t adjust His mission or His message to keep others comfortable. Jesus left the crowds to withdraw and rest.</p>
<p>If Jesus Himself modeled a life that was constructed of healthy boundaries, clarity, and authenticity, why would people-pleasing be the right lifestyle for His followers?</p>
<h3>When Therapy Becomes Necessary</h3>
<p>People-pleasing is often rooted in early experiences or trauma. Maybe you grew up in a home where conflict was dangerous or where love had to be earned. Or maybe being “easy to be around” got you praise, and speaking your mind resulted in punishment.</p>
<img alt="How Being a People Pleaser Can Invite Toxic Friendships 1" class="alignleft wp-image-44222" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/how-being-a-people-pleaser-can-invite-toxic-friendships-2-500x500.jpg" width="300" />These early established patterns can take root in every part of your being. They are tied to your emotions and relationships and can even influence neurological pathways. God gives us a way out of these deeply ingrained influences. Scripture gives us wisdom and truth on the topic, but sometimes therapy can help you learn how to apply that truth in specific and personal ways, unique to your life.</p>
<p>A good Christian therapist will honor your values and help you identify your triggers for saying “yes” when you would rather say “no” and uncover the hidden fears that motivate you. They can also help you practice assertiveness in a safe and manageable way, where there are no consequences, and help you build a healthier view of your worth.</p>
<h3>Speaking your mind makes you authentic</h3>
<p>Many people-pleasers are afraid to speak their mind. They think that being honest and authentic will make them sound rude or selfish. They worry that people won’t like the “real” them, so they do what they have been groomed to do: agree and not make any “waves.”</p>
<p>So, with a nod and a smile, they utter phrases like, “I’m fine with anything.” Deep down, they fear that if they say what they really want, people won’t like them, and if they show their real selves, people will just walk away.</p>
<p>This fear often runs deep and is rooted in deeply set insecurities. But it is also baseless.</p>
<p>Speaking your mind is not rude; it is authentic and transparent. Real people are magnetic! There’s something deeply attractive about someone who knows what they think, says it plainly, and doesn’t twist themselves to fit everyone else’s comfort. The people around you may not always agree with you, but chances are that they will respect you.</p>
<p>People-pleasers, in all their attempts to be agreeable, often appear incredibly fake to those around them. When someone agrees with everything, never has a preference, and constantly avoids conflict, those around them do not truly connect with them as a person.</p>
<p>They’re actually connecting with that person’s fear response. Most people are attracted to truth. They want clarity and relationships where no one is guessing how the other person is feeling or what they are thinking, or walking on eggshells.</p>
<p>A strong person can say, “I disagree” with you without hostility and can say “no” without guilt. Strong people are not necessarily harsh, but steady, grounded, and clear. They can say, “This is what I need” without the urge to apologize. That type of person comes across as trustworthy, and with them, you know exactly where you stand.</p>
<h3>Letting God Define Love</h3>
<p>At the core, people-pleasing is all about control. If you’re a people pleaser, you are trying to manage how others see you, how they respond to you, and how they treat you. It might feel safe, but it’s actually a quiet, less obvious form of manipulation. You aren’t giving people the full truth about yourself. You’re giving them what you think they want to avoid discomfort, rejection, or disapproval.</p>
<p>God wants you to walk in truth and love. And the truth is, sometimes love says no. Sometimes it disappoints people, and sometimes it even lets someone else feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Encouragement for the Future</h3>
<p>If you are in relationships that feel toxic due to your need to people-please, realize that it’s not too late to change the dynamic.</p>
<p>You don’t have to flip the switch overnight, but you can start to make small changes that will help you find a more balanced relationship. Start by saying what you want to eat for dinner, or let a voicemail go unanswered. Be brave enough to cancel plans that you said “yes” to out of guilt, and little by little, those small acts of honest bravery can turn into a life of integrity.</p>
<p>From that new place in your life, you will attract more genuine friendships that are built on mutual respect, and you may even discover confidence that you didn’t know was buried under all your need for compliance.</p>
<p>Becoming a recovering people-pleaser does not require you to become harsh or mean, but it does require you to realize that your voice and opinion matter and that you’re an important member of God’s family.</p>

<title>I Am Angry: What Now?</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>You might have uttered these words (or thought them): “I am angry.” So, how do you know what to do next?</p>
<p>Maybe it was something your spouse did but forgot to run by you. Or perhaps one of your children failed to do something they said they would. It could be a work-related trigger: a sudden deadline, a criticism from a co-worker, or a pay cut. Whatever the anger triggers, believe it or not, it’s what follows that matters.</p>
<p>Here’s what comes next.</p>
<h3>“I am angry” receives acknowledgement</h3>
<p>We sometimes think our best recourse when a negative emotion pops up is to ignore it. We scroll through our phone, find a snack, jump in the car to leave, or turn on the television. But these are simply distractions from what’s essential about the anger we feel: admitting it.</p>
<p>Admitting to yourself, “I am angry,” is the kindest way to move forward. First, research indicates that acknowledging your negative emotions leads to fewer negative emotions. You’re essentially telling yourself that anger is simply where you’re at right now, and you don’t need to react.</p>
<img alt="I Am Angry: What Now?" class="alignleft wp-image-57318" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-500x333.jpg" width="300" />It’s like grabbing a map and finding the <em>You Are Here</em> square at the local shopping mall. There’s no shame in finding out where you are.</p>
<p>If you get into a pattern that communicates that negative emotions and thoughts are a part of life, you’re setting yourself up for a healthy habit. Here’s why. When you’re able to recognize the validity of negative emotions as part of a whole, authentic experience, you can also accept yourself fully without judgment. Then, you can move on to the next step.</p>
<h3>Reflection is essential</h3>
<p>Second, after you’ve acknowledged how you feel, you can consider what to do next. It may seem clear what your next step is, but now that you know what you’re feeling is anger, do you know why?</p>
<p>Evaluate what led to your anger and recognize that your anger may be deeper than the actual trigger. For example, if you found out that your spouse made a large purchase with the tax refund, anger may arise because you and your spouse have had trust issues in the past.</p>
<p><img alt="I Am Angry: What Now? 1" class="alignright wp-image-57319" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-2-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Perhaps you prefer to control the financial well-being of your household (which could stem from a lack of financial control in your family of origin), or you feel left out and neglected by your spouse since they didn’t discuss the purchase with you.</p>
<p>The second step is to ask yourself a question that helps you reflect on your anger. You can even have a fill-in-the-blank on your journal page: <em>I am angry because____</em> and complete the sentence. Then, ask yourself if that complete sentence tells the whole story.</p>
<p>Here is another example. If your sentence says something like, “I am angry because my son promised to take out the trash and clean his room, and he didn’t,” you may want to ask a follow-up question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does this make me angry?</li>
<li>Is it because I feel like the cleanliness of his room is a reflection of me as a parent?</li>
<li>Is it that my expectations weren’t met, and now I feel like the entire weight of our household chores fall on me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider what is beneath the anger and take some time to write about it if you can. If you’re driving or you don’t have time right now, open the recording app on your phone and talk freely. When we’re able to voice our emotions and distinguish between the emotional trigger and what’s beneath it, we’re on our way to releasing it.</p>
<h3>Let anger teach you</h3>
<p>Third, don’t fixate on the ins and outs of why you’re angry and try to solve it. For instance, if you are angry because of a relational conflict, you don’t have to fix it all right now. In fact, you might not be able to fix all of it. Instead, focus on what you can learn from your anger. It can be cognitively reframed to help you recognize when you’re making a quick assessment.</p>
<p>In the example of a child who didn’t do the chores as promised, your anger may make you realize you’re jumping to a conclusion. If there’s a compassionate reason behind one or more of the chores being left undone, you’ll know to ask questions and remain curious. This is beneficial in and of itself, even if there isn’t a logical reason for the undone chores. Still, you’ll have gained an emotional regulatory skill that benefits you in the long term.</p>
<p><img alt="I Am Angry: What Now? 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57320" height="217" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-3-500x361.jpg" width="300" />Instead of ruminating on why you’re upset or your expectations weren’t met, you can look for what the emotion is trying to communicate. That is the role that all emotions, whether we feel them as negative or positive, have in our lives. They tell us to pay attention.</p>
<p>Recognizing anger as a means of paying attention is a gift. You might need a few minutes to receive it as such, but the more often you recognize emotions as a communication tool, the better. You will be more likely to develop the positive habit of seeing what’s beneath the emotion rather than letting it distract you, lead you to cope in unhealthy ways, or place additional stress on relationships.</p>
<h3>Ask for help</h3>
<p>Another helpful step in knowing how to respond to anger is finding a counselor who can help you assess its function in your life.</p>
<p>Everyone gets angry. We wouldn’t be human if we didn’t. But not everyone responds to anger with unhealthy coping mechanisms or by raising their voice at anyone who will listen. This is why some drivers have road rage while others don’t. Sure, it’s frustrating when another driver cuts in front of you, but it doesn’t send everyone into an angry explosion that leads to reckless driving.</p>
<p>Having someone in your life who is a trained, licensed professional will help. They can give you confidence in areas where anger has taken you down paths you’d prefer not to go down. If you wish your anger could be better managed on a regular basis, or if you’ve made some mistakes due to anger before, let an outsider in.</p>
<p>Admitting to someone else, “I am angry,” is a vulnerable thing to do, but it’s also a healthy sign that you’re open to change. Being open to change means you are willing to be transformed by integrating new behavioral and relational tools into your everyday life.</p>
<p><img alt="I Am Angry: What Now? 3" class="alignright wp-image-57321" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/i-am-angry-what-now-4-500x334.jpg" width="300" />A trained counselor will never judge you or shame your actions. His or her role is to help you gain perspective that’s difficult to see on your own. Everyone has blind spots, and anger may be covering some of yours. As you convey how you’re doing, a counselor can give you objective feedback based on compassionate care, aligning with your priorities.</p>
<p>Most people don’t set out to be angry, bitter, or resentful. Working through your negative emotions as they happen is a route toward forgiveness, freedom, and healthy relationships. You’ll be able to learn what your anger triggers are, some ways to cope with them that are beneficial and kind, and learn new habits to further your desire to be your best self.</p>
<p>In His kindness, the Bible tells us, God leads us to repentance. (Romans 2:4) This means that He not only sees when we are angry, but He highlights it so we’re aware of it. Why? So we can turn from unhelpful patterns to helpful ones.</p>
<p>While anger itself isn’t sinful, sometimes we cope with it through sinful habits. Any coping mechanism you might be using that ignores your love for God and doesn’t invite authenticity is just delaying what you likely already know: I am angry. Avoiding the emotion isn’t going to help. Instead, it can make anger more complex to manage.</p>
<p>Setting yourself up to manage anger in a healthy way will not be easy. It also won’t change overnight, particularly if it’s been a lifelong struggle. However, taking the steps to acknowledge it, reflect on why you’re angry, recognize what you can control or reframe, and find a trusted counselor to walk alongside you are all hope-filled ways to turn a new corner.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been there. The crowded malls. The shoulder-to-shoulder seats in the auditorium for the children’s Christmas concert. The large family gathering. The Fall Festival or Christmas Parade.</p>
<p>But for someone with social anxiety disorder, these occasions create a sense of panic, making it hard to breathe and difficult to think. They may have a panic attack not only at the event, but on the way. Or, even a few days beforehand, as they imagine the scenario.</p>
<p>Social anxiety disorder can cause conflict at home, work, and in relationships. However, with practice, patience, and grace, you can manage the symptoms of social anxiety disorder.</p>
<h3>Tips for Managing Social Anxiety Disorder This Holiday Season</h3>
<p>This holiday season doesn’t have to end up like last year’s. You can take control of social anxiety disorder with a few psychological strategies, lifestyle changes, and planned events. It’s essential to remember, as you journey through healing and alleviating symptoms, that the reason we celebrate the holidays is centered on God’s gift, the birth of Jesus. Followed by the ringing in of a new year with our families, to be the person God created us to be.</p>
<p>Prayer should be at the backbone of learning how to manage any mental condition. Drawing closer to Christ enables you to see the grace and mercy that He offers. When we allow those traits to wash over us, a sense of peace grows. It is through this peace that we can find freedom as we work through the symptoms of social anxiety disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Talk to a counselor</strong></p>
<p>Talking to a counselor can help you discover what is behind your social anxiety and examine the thoughts and beliefs that have become its foundation. Often, we believe intrusive thoughts, even when they are false. Counseling and talk therapy can help challenge these negative beliefs.</p>
<p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a method that mental health practitioners use to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, aiming to change emotions and behaviors. You will learn how to identify and challenge these thoughts and replace them with positive ones. You will learn new coping mechanisms to help you deal with social anxiety disorder symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Look into virtual group sessions</strong></p>
<p>Virtual group sessions may sound scary to someone struggling with social anxiety, but they offer gradual exposure in a safe setting. For example, if you are invited to a virtual support group with others, you can choose to leave your camera off until you are ready to try it for yourself. You can speak up in small answer sessions. Smaller groups may make you feel more confident. If you feel panicked, you can turn off your camera or ask for help.</p>
<p>The others in the group have also struggled with social anxiety. Some may have overcome the symptoms and now work with others. Some participants may offer advice and encouragement. Ask your counselor or check with your local hospital or community center to find out about virtual support groups led by a mental health professional.</p>
<p><strong>Start walking</strong></p>
<img alt="Managing Social Anxiety Disorder Around the Holidays 1" class="alignleft wp-image-57309" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/managing-social-anxiety-disorder-around-the-holidays-2-500x334.jpg" width="300" />Although walking can be a solitary venture, focus mainly on the health benefits initially. Walking at a brisk pace gets the heart pumping, and this action triggers the release of hormones, such as serotonin and dopamine, which can leave you feeling less stressed and happier. Endorphins are also released, further leaving you with a sense of confidence and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Use the benefits of walking to propel you out of your comfort zone. Once you start to feel more confident, try lengthening your walk into areas that are a little more crowded or consider joining a walking group. If you shop in a mall or plaza, walk a few laps around between stores. Continue to challenge yourself physically and mentally by changing the setting or distance.</p>
<p><strong>Pencil in only meaningful events</strong>
<p>The holidays can place undue stress on you with activities, starting in October and lasting until New Year’s Day. If social anxiety is an issue, only pencil in the meaningful events. This might be your child’s Christmas performance at school and the family get-together on Christmas Eve. You do not have to attend every invite at least until you have a better handle on your symptoms and have adopted healthy coping mechanisms to navigate through holiday events.</p>
<p>Politely decline by addressing that you would love to, but you have had to cut back on events this year. You are doing this for your mental health and wellness. Committing to more holiday events than you can handle will only leave you stressed and dreading the event. Choose the events that are important to you and your family. When you feel more confident, you can add more.</p>
<p><strong>Tame your stress with deep breathing</strong></p>
<p>Chronic stress worsens social anxiety. It is a vicious cycle. You dread an upcoming event to the point of physical symptoms and panic attacks. Yet, you may carry an underlying anxiety disorder, and chronic stress triggers those reactions.</p>
<p>You can tame your stress by pausing and practicing deep breathing. When we get anxious, we breathe faster and shallower, preparing our bodies to run from perceived danger. Deep breathing forces us to be still and focus on breathing, filling our lungs to capacity and then slowly exhaling through the mouth. Try inhaling through the nose for the count of four, holding the breath for the count of seven, then releasing through the mouth for the count of eight. Repeat as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Practice communication skills</strong></p>
<p>Social anxiety disorder can make you feel vulnerable, shy, and awkward. You may have trouble speaking to others or making eye contact. Communication skills are learned skills. You can learn to step gradually out of your comfort zone to have conversations and ask questions, all while maintaining eye contact with others.</p>
<p>A counselor can teach you the necessary communication skills, including active listening. You can practice with your counselor, and then go out into the world to apply what you’ve learned. The process is dependent on how your confidence grows. For example, your counselor may suggest that you try holding eye contact while talking to at least three people this week and report back on your progress.</p>
<p><strong>Give yourself plenty of time to recharge</strong></p>
<p>Social events can be especially draining to someone struggling with social anxiety disorder. This holiday season, as you choose events that mean the most to you, plan for breaks in between. For example, if you attend a Christmas concert on a Friday evening, give yourself Saturday to recharge.</p>
<p>You can use this strategy throughout the year as well. Choose a day to grocery shop and run errands only when you can enjoy the following day as downtime. On these peaceful, recharging days, do an activity that you love and provides peace for your soul.</p>
<p><strong>Try gradual exposure</strong></p>
<p>Gradual exposure ensures that you are challenging yourself while still being in control. During the holidays, gradual exposure could involve joining a small caroling group, walking through familiar neighborhoods to sing. It could be shopping at your favorite store at the least busiest time with a short list. Gradual exposure could also involve buying a coffee or hot chocolate and sitting in a relaxed café, listening to others, and taking note of how you feel.</p>
<p>The more you expose yourself to social gatherings, the more at ease you will eventually feel. Some people can tolerate small gatherings fine, but panic in packed auditoriums. As you progress through exposure therapy, you will work up to social events that you feel a little more at ease at while implementing healthy coping mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
<p>Christian counseling combines faith in God with psychology to help shift mindset, heal trauma, and overcome the symptoms of mental conditions. Social anxiety disorder doesn’t have to end your fun. You can make changes in your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors leading up to this holiday season. Contact our center today to get started.</p>

<title>Mental Health for Teens: Challenges and Opportunities to Provide Support</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A person’s mental health affects much of how they function in daily life. The same is true when we’re talking about mental health for teens. There’s a school of thought suggesting that mental health doesn’t matter; that whatever comes your way, you just need a stiff upper lip and to simply push through it or past it. Resilience is a good thing, but it must be part of a healthy approach to one’s well-being, which includes mental health.</p>
<p>Teens may seem quite carefree, with ‘seem’ being the operative word. Teens may not face the same challenges that people in other age groups do, but that doesn’t mean they don’t experience similar challenges, or challenges that are particular to their stage of life. Knowing what good mental health is, and how to nurture it can be helpful to teens and to their parents or caregivers.</p>
<h3>Defining Good Mental Health for Teens</h3>
<p>Mental health is about more than just whether you have a healthy brain or your mind is in good working order. One good way to think of mental health is holistically. It’s about your capacity to handle life’s adversities, how you view yourself, and how adaptable you are to life’s many ups and downs.</p>
<p>A person with good mental health can manage stress effectively. The ability to adapt to changes and challenges is also a sign of good mental health. You can be said to be in good mental health if you’re able to initiate and maintain fulfilling and healthy relationships with others. Making sound decisions that promote your well-being and help you accomplish your goals is also a part of having good mental health.</p>
<p>Other facets of good mental health include the ability to enjoy life and have a positive self-image. How you view yourself, and how you treat and relate to yourself, are all part of mental health. If you don’t value yourself or see your self-worth and dignity as a creature made in God’s image, it affects your mental health. It will impact how you treat yourself and relate to others.</p>
<p>Lastly, good mental health is also about having emotional resilience. That’s the ability to bounce back from hardship and weather the storms of life. Life will always give us lemons. After all, we live in a fallen and broken world. We experience loss, grief, rejection, disappointment, and many other things. The ability to go on despite these realities is called resilience, and it’s also an aspect of good mental health.</p>
<h3>Some Challenges for Teen Mental Health</h3>
<p>Having good mental health doesn’t mean you won’t face problems or that you won’t struggle. Rather, good mental health means that <em>when </em>you face those challenges, you’re able to face them well. You might get knocked down, but you’ll be able to get up again, and again, and again.</p>
<p>There are some significant challenges when it comes to mental health for teens. Teens face the same issues as adults, like dealing with the loss of loved ones or feeling overwhelmed by life’s pressures. They do, however, face issues more specific to their stage of life. As their parent or caregiver, there may be parallels to your own past experiences, which can help you empathize with them.</p>
<p>Some of the unique and main challenges that teens face that can negatively impact their mental well-being include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Social and interpersonal dynamics</strong> Unfortunately, the teen years can be fraught with issues such as bullying, whether in person or online. Teens may experience, acutely and perhaps for the first time, peer pressure and the deep desire to fit in. No one wants to stand out for the wrong reasons, and that feeling is quite pronounced during the teen years.</p>
<p><strong>Family concerns</strong> Teen mental health can also be affected by issues within their family. Examples include family financial difficulties that change their circumstances drastically, their parents getting divorced, or family conflict. Conflict can be a huge source of stress.</p>
<p><strong>Academic pressures</strong> Teens also face enormous amounts of stress from exams, grades, working toward future career prospects, performing well academically, and participating in their extracurricular activities. Many young people also carry a burden for the future, and they want the world to change. This can become overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>Social media and technology</strong> Being connected to the world 24/7 via social and other media can be a huge burden. Not only is cyberbullying and the nastiness spread across the internet a thing to contend with, but there’s also exposure to highly unrealistic and damaging standards of beauty or fitness found online. This can feed deep discontent with one’s body or lifestyle, especially in this stage wrought with change.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Mental Health for Teens: Challenges and Opportunities to Provide Support" class="alignleft wp-image-44210" height="225" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/mental-health-for-teens-challenges-and-opportunities-to-provide-support-500x375.jpg" width="300" />Development of personal identity</strong> As a period of transitions and massive changes, the teen years are a time of trying to understand huge questions such as “Who am I? What do I believe in? What matters most to me?” A teen may struggle with their mental well-being as they wrestle with questions of their racial or cultural identity, and as they try to make sense of their sexuality or questions about their gender identity.</p>
<h3>Might your teen be in poor mental health? Signs to Look Out For</h3>
<p>When you live with a teen, you may get your fair share of surly responses, anger outbursts, changes in their behavior, adjustments to arrangements, and so on. They are growing up, and that means they’re renegotiating their place in the world. Friction can sometimes result from this process, and tempers can flare up. How do you tell the difference between this, and signs of distress in your teen?</p>
<p>Some of the signs that your teen might be struggling and not in good mental health would include these:</p>
<p><strong>Reckless behaviors</strong> If your teen is engaging in risky behaviors such as self-harm (cutting, biting, scratching themselves, and so on), substance abuse (drugs, alcohol, or other substances), or being reckless with their own well-being through speeding or otherwise endangering themselves, that might be a sign of poor mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Mood disruptions</strong> If your teen is experiencing irritability, persistent sadness, or mood swings that last for a long while, that might also point to an issue with their mental health. If they are experiencing excessive anxiety that prevents them from going to school or socializing with others, it’s a cause for concern.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in behavior</strong> If your teen has changes that are sudden, drastic, and seem detrimental to well-being, it’s worth paying attention to. Such changes could include a loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, marked changes in sleeping and eating habits that lead to negative life outcomes, or withdrawal from loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Signs of cognitive decline</strong> If your teen shows signs of their cognitive abilities being impacted negatively, they could point to deeper underlying issues. These could include your teen having difficulty making decisions, their academic performance declining drastically without an identifiable reason, or having difficulty remembering things, concentrating, and completing tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Physical complaints</strong> If your teen has physical symptoms like stomachaches, fatigue, or unexplained headaches, these may suggest deeper concerns. That’s more significant if these ailments don’t respond to the typical treatments for them.</p>
<h3>Providing Support to Nurture Your Teen’s Mental Health</h3>
<p>Parents, caregivers, and other leaders have a positive, significant role to play when it comes to mental health for teens. You can play a role by being aware of how and why poor mental health can occur in an individual’s life. Notice things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A family history of poor mental health and health disorders</li>
<li>Environmental stressors like abuse, neglect, or trauma</li>
<li>A lack of support</li>
<li>Physical health issues, such as being sick or having a chronic health condition</li>
<li>Hormonal fluctuations that come with adolescence</li>
</ul>
<p>Being aware of what’s happening in a teen’s life can make a difference.</p>
<p>Parents and caregivers can provide support to their teen by being vigilant, empathetic, and proactively involved in their teen’s life. Learning about mental health for teens can help. Apart from being educated, paying attention and being observant so that you notice changes in mood or behavior also matters. You can slowly and gently introduce new, healthy habits, like good sleep hygiene, reducing time on devices, eating healthy, or getting physical exercise.</p>
<p>It can take time to break old habits, such as poor listening, overcoming past conflict, and a lack of understanding. Give it time and keep trying. It takes time and consistency to build trust. That consistency is not just showing up consistently, but showing up with love, patience, understanding, and a gentle truthfulness (Ephesians 4:15; 29). This creates a safe space for your teen to be themselves and a willingness to share who they are.</p>
<p>You can also use professional counseling for support. Your teen can go for individual or group counseling to address particular concerns, or your family can go for family therapy if there are dynamics that are contributing to poor mental health. Your teen’s mental health matters. Reach out and talk with a Christian counselor to help your teen work through their challenges and grow into the young person the Lord intends them to be.</p>

<title>Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>When you finally reach adulthood, there is an expectation that the cattiness and drama of middle school will be safely locked in the past. Unfortunately, just because you reach the age of accountability and start interacting in the world as a full-fledged adult, there is no guarantee that you will be free of pettiness and social issues.</p>
<p>Exclusion, gossip, and cliques don’t vanish with age; they simply take on new forms. Instead of the drama of who sits together in the school cafeteria, the issue becomes who gets excluded in after-work hangouts or who gets favoritism from the boss. Being left out as an adult can sting just as deeply as it did when you were a kid. When it happens in the workplace, a place where you spend so much of your life, it can leave you feeling isolated and undervalued.</p>
<h3>Why You Might Be Excluded</h3>
<p>There could be hundreds of reasons you’re being excluded at work, but it’s probably not the one you think. It’s natural to shift the blame to yourself when you’re excluded. Self-flogging is often the default after failure.</p>
<img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace" class="alignleft wp-image-57297" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-500x333.jpg" width="300" />You might wonder what you’ve done to turn people so against you. You might anguish about why you don’t measure up in the eyes of your boss or coworkers. You might analyze your work ethic, critique your humor, cringe at your own awkwardness, and scrutinize every conversation, looking for hints as to why you’re being excluded.</p>
<p>If this feels familiar, it’s good to prayerfully survey your life. Then you can look for areas to improve. Authenticity and humility are both goals as a Christian, as is growth in Christ. When your self-esteem and self-assessment are tied to the way you’re treated by others, you may not see things clearly. The way other people treat you might influence how you view yourself. And when people in your workplace don’t treat you right, it can negatively distort your sense of self.</p>
<p>During this period of self-analysis, you might conclude that you’re being excluded from the company party or being excluded from after-work gatherings because there is something intrinsically wrong with you. It’s natural to find fault with yourself, especially when you’ve already been beaten down by external factors. But these faults that you have identified might not actually be what is dictating others’ behaviors.</p>
<h3>Jealousy, Greed, or Fear</h3>
<p>Anytime you find yourself criticized or excluded, it’s important to take a step back and ask yourself what those who are excluding you have to gain from it. People are motivated by many things, but if you trace all those various types of motivations back to their roots, you will usually find jealousy, greed, or fear at the center. Exclusion in the workplace has less to do with who you are and a whole lot more to do with the insecurities of others.</p>
<p>Jealousy shows up in subtle ways, like being left out of conversations, not being invited to lunch, or in the silence that settles over the room when you walk through the door. It can show up in bigger ways, too, often confirming your suspicions of being excluded.</p>
<p>Scripture talks about the destruction of jealousy and what envy does to people and relationships. Proverbs says, “A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots to the bones.” (Proverbs 14:30 NIV) Envy may take root in a co-worker’s heart, but the damage can spill over and hurt the culture and connections around them.</p>
<p><img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace 1" class="alignright wp-image-57298" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-2-500x334.jpg" width="300" />James also talks about jealousy and its power to destroy. “For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and every evil practice” (James 3:16, NIV). That “disorder and every evil practice” can manifest in the workplace as gossip, cliques, and a culture of exclusion.</p>
<p>Seeing jealousy as a fault in those who suffer from it can help shift your perspective. Instead of automatically assuming that you’re the problem, recognize that exclusion often flows out of someone else’s insecurity.</p>
<p>If you’ve had success in life, progress in your job, or appear to have it all together, your coworkers might perceive you as a threat, even if you have never intended to compete with anyone. Their insecurity can make them act out, subtly or overtly, by excluding you, gossiping, or refusing to work with you. This behavior says more about them than it does about your worth or abilities.</p>
<p>Greed is also a contributing factor to exclusion. Some people are motivated by money, status, or advancement. If a coworker perceives you as an obstacle to a promotion, a threat to their reputation, or someone blocking a financial gain, they might exclude you to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Scripture even warns us that greed can influence behavior. “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs,” (1 Timothy 6:10, NIV).</p>
<p>Fear is also a contributing factor in workplace exclusion. Coworkers might fear you, not as a villain, but because you represent something different. Their behavior toward you might not have anything to do with envy or personal advancement, but simply be a fear of change and the unknown.</p>
<p>A coworker might resist including you in projects, decision-making processes, or social activities because you are unfamiliar. People often stick with what feels comfortable.</p>
<p><img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57299" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />There are times you might be part of the problem that leads to being excluded. Be sure to ask God for wisdom and remember there is usually a lot more to it than what you think. Striving to do your best and practicing prayerful reflection about your own attitude and work ethic is important.</p>
<p>When you do this, however, don’t default to assuming that every problem at work is because of some fault in you. It is good, healthy even, to examine your own actions and to grow in your personal relationship with Christ, but exclusion is complex and often rooted in external factors.</p>
<h3>Dealing with Exclusion in the Workplace</h3>
<p>So how can you handle being left out at your place of employment?</p>
<p>First and foremost, maintain your integrity. Your first priority is to do your work as unto the Lord, not your coworker, boss, or company. Keep doing your job well and treating others with respect, even when they don’t do the same. It might be tempting to mirror negative behavior, but your relationship with God should dictate your behavior, allowing you to rise above emotional immaturity.</p>
<p><img alt="Being Excluded and Loneliness in the Workplace 3" class="alignright wp-image-57300" height="225" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/being-excluded-and-loneliness-in-the-workplace-4-500x375.jpg" width="300" />You also must learn how to set and maintain healthy boundaries (yes, even if you’re not the boss). Part of that process includes understanding your legal rights and protecting yourself from those who don’t respect them. Know when to engage and when to step out of potentially toxic situations. Find the balance between rightfully defending yourself and perpetuating workplace toxicity.</p>
<p>You can also seek support from a licensed therapist. A professional mental health specialist can help you process the hurtful feelings of exclusion, learn to set those boundaries, and gain some perspective on difficult workplace situations.</p>
<h3>You’re not defined by them</h3>
<p>Thankfully, you’re not defined by your coworkers or boss; you’re defined by God. Your Creator loves you and won’t ever exclude you. In fact, He was so passionate about including you in His family that He sent His own Son to die on a cross so you wouldn’t be excluded. And that type of inclusion supersedes anything that happens on Earth.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>We all go through traumas that shape the way we see the world. For example, we might have a series of negative experiences while traveling abroad, which leads us to conclude that the particular country and culture we visited was awful and inhospitable.</p>
<p>These trauma-informed biases become a lens through which we understand and evaluate the world. However, these lenses are often so warped, cracked, and badly scratched that we don’t see an accurate picture of the world. This is what we call cognitive distortions.</p>
<p>We all have cognitive distortions without even realizing it. These false assumptions and irrational thought patterns often amount to little more than misinformation and prejudice. We can challenge these things and change our minds when presented with other perspectives. However, sometimes these cognitive distortions influence our behavior to toxic degrees.</p>
<p>Unless we identify them and challenge them, they can keep us stuck in certain behaviors, they can poison our relationships, and they can erode our self-esteem.</p>
<p>Jesus once said that before we try to remove the speck of dust from someone else’s eye, we should first remove the log from our own. Challenging our own cognitive distortions means removing those cracked lenses that have been partially blinding us, and, for the first time, seeing a different, more accurate perspective. That is when we realize that the log in our own eye had been obscuring our vision for most of our lives.</p>
<h3>The Ten Most Common Cognitive Distortions</h3>
<p>When we have a warped idea about reality and constantly come to false conclusions about events, we will end up getting stuck. The more cognitive distortions we have, the more we will struggle to grow, heal, and advance in life. We don’t have to feel ashamed for being so affected by these cognitive distortions, but it is essential to confront them.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization</strong></p>
<p>Personalization is when you take the blame for everything that goes wrong. For example, your partner might be in a bad mood, and you automatically assume it is in relation to something you did. You might see a group of people laughing, and you assume they are mocking you. Centering yourself in every event is one of the most common and damaging cognitive distortions.</p>
<p>You challenge this distortion with a perspective shift. Refocus on the reality that not everything revolves around you. You will cause many things to happen in life, but you are not central to as central as you imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Overgeneralization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“The French are rude because that one guy cut me off when I was in Paris.”</li>
<li>“I failed the test; I guess academia must not be for me.”</li>
<li>“He didn’t reply to my text. Everyone is ignoring me!”</li>
</ul>
<p>Broad conclusions like these are distortions of reality because each one is based on a single event or a selective piece of evidence.</p>
<p>The way to challenge these biases is to find exceptions to these statements. Life is so much more nuanced. One experience is not enough evidence to make sweeping conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/challenging-ten-of-the-most-common-cognitive-distortions.jpg"><img alt="cognitive distortions" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-86291" height="169" src="http://localshrink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/roma-kaiuk-r-Q_VIl6uC8-unsplash-300x169.jpg" width="300" /></a>If you were the type of person who was disappointed by the single B amid a sea of A’s on your exam results, you were probably filtering. This is where you ignore all the positives and focus on the negative outcomes. Your perfect day is ruined by one interaction, and it is the single criticism that tanks your mood after giving your work presentation.</p>
<p>You challenge this cognitive distortion by practicing gratitude. Find the positives and celebrate them. Write them down, frame them, or keep a journal of them to remind you.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Reading</strong></p>
<p>This cognitive distortion is common, and it is more damaging to your self-esteem than all the rest. It is where you assume what others are thinking based on no actual evidence. You assume someone is mad at you for not saying hi, that they are bored with your company because they are silent, or that they haven’t forgiven you because you didn’t get an invite to a recent party.</p>
<p>The only way to challenge this is with direct and open communication. Be bold and ask direct questions. Clarify doubt and questioning, querying, and checking in with people.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>This distortion comes from allowing your feelings to dictate your reality. You know that you have done something wrong because you feel guilty. You believe you are unlovable because you feel lonely. You know that the job isn’t the right one for you because it has caused you to struggle and feel overwhelmed. None of these are facts; they are feelings that will change.</p>
<p>This distortion is challenged by finding provable facts. Be diligent in looking for proof for your conclusions, beyond the way you feel. If it can be proven, it is true, and if not, it is only a feeling. Emotions obviously affect your mindset, but they should never dictate your reality.</p>
<p><strong>Catastrophizing</strong></p>
<p>If you always expect the worst-case scenario will happen, you are likely guilty of catastrophizing. You feel like you have ruined things by making one mistake, that something terrible must’ve happened because a friend is late, or that you have contracted a virus because you have a runny nose. This kind of thinking not only keeps you in a state of panic all the time, but it puts others on edge, too.</p>
<p>You need to learn to check reality. Just because something is possible does not mean it is likely. Make a point of noticing how often things go right, especially when you expected something other than a positive outcome.</p>
<p><strong>All or Nothing Extreme Thinking</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t see nuances, gray areas, or the middle ground, your view of reality is distorted. Life is messy and unpredictable, made of wonderful, neutral, and awful things. People are not your enemy for disagreeing with you. Even excellent people have flaws, and it wasn’t a total failure just because something went wrong. Your extreme thinking will alienate your loved ones unless you allow it to be challenged.</p>
<p><strong>Fortune Telling</strong></p>
<p>Accurately foretelling the future would be wonderful, but we can’t. You may sound confident making predictions with this cognitive distortion, such as you will never find love, culture will erode morals, or the year will end on a bad note, but there’s no way you can know that. We can only live one day at a time and do what we can in each present moment. That is your challenge.</p>
<p><strong>“Should” Statements</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, a strict moral code is a distortion in our thinking that aggravates mental health issues. If we are so rigid in holding ourselves and others to this code, we will end up anxious, angry, and frustrated because life is imperfect. Our challenge is that we don’t always have to be successful, or strong, or even happy. Life is a mix of good and bad and in between.</p>
<p><strong>Magnification and Minimization</strong></p>
<p>We often exaggerate the importance of things beginning in our teens. We may focus on our favorite singers or sports stars, while also underestimating the value of other things, like spending time with our siblings. When this mode of thinking carries over into adulthood, it’s often a cognitive distortion. For example, we might downplay a compliment from someone we love, while fixating on a simple mistake we made at work.</p>
<p>As with so many of the other cognitive distortions, we need to challenge this by adopting proportional thinking. We must learn to keep things in perspective. There are real challenges, but they are balanced with genuine breakthroughs. It is only when we can identify both and distinguish them from each other that we begin seeing the world through a clear lens.</p>
<h3>Discover a new way of thinking</h3>
<p>It’s hard to challenge cognitive distortions alone because most of the time, we can’t see how they’re affecting us. Try speaking with a counselor about any cognitive distortions you’re concerned about. You may find a counselor in this online catalog, or our reception team can help you find someone appropriate. Connect with someone today to learn how to find freedom from cognitive distortions.</p>

<title>No Shame On You</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>One day, my then-thirteen-year-old daughter and I were playing around. She did something, and I jokingly said, “Shame on you!!” But something in my spirit quickened, and I said, “No! No shame on you! No shame in any of us once we have accepted Christ! Our shame is under the blood!”</p>
<p>Many people, even many Christians, deal with guilt and shame. What’s the difference between guilt and shame? I like the way Sheila Walsh explains it in her book <em>5 Minutes with Jesus: Making Today Matter</em>, “Guilt tells us that we’ve done something wrong; shame tells us that we <em>are</em> something wrong” (p. 32). But she also tells us that the antidote to shame is God’s love.</p>
<p>I love the song by Miranda Lambert (Country artist), “The House that Built Me.” She talks about going back to her childhood home to get some brokenness healed. It’s a gorgeous song. But it doesn’t fully resonate with me. For me, it was the opposite when I visited my hometown. I had bad memories, and condemnation would come in. The enemy would remind me of all the sin I had in my life before I came to Jesus.</p>
<p>One time after getting back from a trip to my hometown, I felt so much condemnation and regret, and I couldn’t shake it. Shortly after arriving home, our pastor at the time preached a message around Romans 8:1, “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” I needed that message at that exact moment. I’ve never forgotten it.</p>
<p>I needed that reminder. I needed that freedom, that release from the old chains being removed. Once I was reminded, I began to hold those negative thoughts captive and remind the enemy that my past was in the past. I have been redeemed. I don’t let the enemy hold my past over my head anymore.</p>
<p>There is a difference between conviction (correction) and condemnation. God whispers gentle reminders to us. It isn’t harsh. It’s a gentle and loving discipline from a good Father. The enemy, on the other hand, makes us feel awful and worthless when he comes at us with condemnation. He will come to us when we are most vulnerable. He’ll even tell us lies about ourselves that we start to believe.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:10 says Satan accuses the brethren day and night. The Bible also tells us, “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.”</p>
<p>What does he come to steal, kill, and destroy?</p>
<p>Steal: He robs people of their peace, joy, and security. He sows doubt and steals faith.</p>
<p>Kill: To extinguish spiritual life: This refers to a spiritual death, leading individuals away from salvation and an abundant life with God. To destroy self-worth and faith: The devil’s actions can kill one’s self-worth or faith in God.</p>
<p>Destroy: To cause chaos and despair: His goal is to bring about total devastation, division, chaos, corruption, and despair in creation and human relationships. To make people give up: By creating terrible situations, the devil tries to weaken a person’s will and make them feel hopeless that their life is over.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jesus wants us to have spiritual peace, joy, meaning, and purpose, which are what the devil seeks to destroy.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I watched The Lion King. I felt like it was an allegory of God, Jesus or us and the devil. Scar (Satan) tempts Simba (us) to go somewhere he isn’t supposed to go. Then, once he goes and there are consequences, he holds the blame over Simba’s head. He makes him feel guilty and unworthy. Even blaming him for something he didn’t even do. If you feel that same kind of guilt, that’s not from God.</p>
<p>The Bible says in Isaiah 43:25:</p>
<p>NLT &#8211; “I – yes, I alone – will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.”</p>
<p>NKJV- “I will not remember your sins!”</p>
<p>If He tells us He won’t remember them, why should we? If we sin and repent, it’s under the blood.</p>
<img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21596" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-shame-on-you.jpg" width="300" />We need to hold negative thoughts captive (as I mentioned before) and remind the devil that Jesus paid it all “…having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross” (Colossians 2:14).</p>
<p>The Bible, good devotionals, Christian music, and reminding myself who I am in Christ help me remember not to allow guilt and shame to try to creep in. There are so many good songs that remind us that God doesn’t want us to be stuck in a pit of shame.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs is “Made for More” by Jenn Johnson, Bethel Music, and Josh Baldwin. These lyrics get me every time:</p>
<p><em>Cause I wasn’t made to be tending a grave</em><br />
<em>I was called by name</em><br />
<em>Born and raised back to life again</em><br />
<em>I was made for more</em><br />
<em>So why would I make a bed in my shame</em><br />
<em>When a fountain of grace is running my way</em><br />
<em>I know I am Yours</em><br />
<em>And I was made for more.</em>
<p>(“Made for More,” by Josh Baldwin, featuring Jenn Johnson, on Josh Baldwin, <em>Made for More</em>,  Bethel Music, 2024)</p>
<p>The enemy used to try to help me make “a bed of shame” before I knew better.</p>
<p>There are two Zach Williams songs that also have helped me. On his “Rescue Story” album there is a song called “Slave to Nothing” which says:</p>
<p><em>You can tell me what I did</em><br />
<em>You  can show me who I was before</em><br />
<em>Where I fell short</em><br />
<em>Hang it over my head</em><br />
<em>But I’m not the same anymore</em><br />
<em>One thing’s for sure</em><br />
<em>The shackles have fallen</em><br />
<em>So, I’m showing shame to the door</em><br />
<em>Make no mistake.</em><br />
<em>I’m a slave to nothing.</em></p>
<p>(“Slave to Nothing,” by Zach Williams, Track 5 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<p>I also love this one by Zach Williams: “Under My Feet”</p>
<p><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>Those chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground</em><br />
<em>You can’t keep digging up my past</em><br />
<em>You may have had a laugh or two, but you don’t get the last</em><br />
<em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>[Chorus]</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was blind but now I see</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was bound but now I’m free</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>Maybe you’re a lie that I don’t need</em><br />
<em>Maybe you should listen when I speak</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>If you want scars, I’ll show you scars</em><br />
<em>All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark</em><br />
<em>If I were you, I’d be afraid</em><br />
<em>Cause everything you meant for guilt the cross has met with grace.</em></p>
<p>(“Under My Feet,” by Zach Williams, Track 6 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved son. For in the Son all our sins are canceled, and we have the release of redemption through his very blood.</em> – <strong>Colossians 1:13-14, TPT</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The NLT reads, “who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.”</p>
<p>Walsh puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>Shame tells us we are worthless. Christ says, “I have made you worthy.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we don’t belong. Christ says, “You are mine.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we are dirty. Chris says, “I will wash you as white as snow.” </em>(p. 33).</p>
<p>If you struggle with guilt and shame, Christian counseling can help you deal with shame by providing a safe, non-judgmental space to get to the root causes from a faith-based perspective.</p>
<p>A counselor will use Bible-based principles, prayer, Scripture, and therapeutic approaches to help you reframe your self-image, find forgiveness, and develop a stronger relationship with God and others. The goal is to move past toxic shame by connecting with God’s grace and remember your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>So, back to “The Lion King.” When Nala finds the now adult Simba, she tells him he needs to come back to help take their home back from Scar. In the animated version, this conversation ensues between Simba and Rafiki:</p>
<p><strong>Simba:</strong> “I know what I have to do. But going back means I’ll have to face my past. I’ve been running from it for so long.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “It doesn’t matter. It’s in the past.”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “Yeah, but it still hurts.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it, or&#8230; learn from it.”</p>
<p>In the newer live/CGI action version this was the conversation that got me:</p>
<p><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I’m nobody.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Everybody is somebody. So, I ask again, who are you?”<br />
Simba hears Mufasa’s voice: “Simba, you must remember who you are: the one true king.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “And so, I asked&#8230;Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I am Simba, son of Mufasa.”</p>
<p>We must remember who and Whose we are.</p>
<p>As Rafiki said, “He lives in you.”</p>

<p>If you struggle with guilt and shame, Christian counseling can help you deal with shame by providing a safe, non-judgmental space to get to the root causes from a faith-based perspective.</p>
<p>A counselor will use Bible-based principles, prayer, Scripture, and therapeutic approaches to help you reframe your self-image, find forgiveness, and develop a stronger relationship with God and others. The goal is to move past toxic shame by connecting with God’s grace and remember your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>So, back to “The Lion King.” When Nala finds the now adult Simba, she tells him he needs to come back to help take their home back from Scar. In the animated version, this conversation ensues between Simba and Rafiki:</p>
<p><strong>Simba:</strong> “I know what I have to do. But going back means I’ll have to face my past. I’ve been running from it for so long.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “It doesn’t matter. It’s in the past.”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “Yeah, but it still hurts.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it, or&#8230; learn from it.”</p>
<p>In the newer live/CGI action version this was the conversation that got me:</p>
<p><strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I’m nobody.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “Everybody is somebody. So, I ask again, who are you?”<br />
Simba hears Mufasa’s voice: “Simba, you must remember who you are: the one true king.”<br />
<strong>Rafiki:</strong> “And so, I asked&#8230;Who are you?”<br />
<strong>Simba:</strong> “I am Simba, son of Mufasa.”</p>
<p>We must remember who and Whose we are.</p>
<p>As Rafiki said, “He lives in you.”</p>

<title>No Shame On You</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>One day, my then-thirteen-year-old daughter and I were playing around. She did something, and I jokingly said, “Shame on you!!” But something in my spirit quickened, and I said, “No! No shame on you! No shame in any of us once we have accepted Christ! Our shame is under the blood!”</p>
<p>Many people, even many Christians, deal with guilt and shame. What’s the difference between guilt and shame? I like the way Sheila Walsh explains it in her book <em>5 Minutes with Jesus: Making Today Matter</em>, “Guilt tells us that we’ve done something wrong; shame tells us that we <em>are</em> something wrong” (p. 32). But she also tells us that the antidote to shame is God’s love.</p>
<p>I love the song by Miranda Lambert (Country artist), “The House that Built Me.” She talks about going back to her childhood home to get some brokenness healed. It’s a gorgeous song. But it doesn’t fully resonate with me. For me, it was the opposite when I visited my hometown. I had bad memories, and condemnation would come in. The enemy would remind me of all the sin I had in my life before I came to Jesus.</p>
<p>One time after getting back from a trip to my hometown, I felt so much condemnation and regret, and I couldn’t shake it. Shortly after arriving home, our pastor at the time preached a message around Romans 8:1, “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” I needed that message at that exact moment. I’ve never forgotten it.</p>
<p>I needed that reminder. I needed that freedom, that release from the old chains being removed. Once I was reminded, I began to hold those negative thoughts captive and remind the enemy that my past was in the past. I have been redeemed. I don’t let the enemy hold my past over my head anymore.</p>
<p>There is a difference between conviction (correction) and condemnation. God whispers gentle reminders to us. It isn’t harsh. It’s a gentle and loving discipline from a good Father. The enemy, on the other hand, makes us feel awful and worthless when he comes at us with condemnation. He will come to us when we are most vulnerable. He’ll even tell us lies about ourselves that we start to believe.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:10 says Satan accuses the brethren day and night. The Bible also tells us, “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.”</p>
<p>What does he come to steal, kill, and destroy?</p>
<p>Steal: He robs people of their peace, joy, and security. He sows doubt and steals faith.</p>
<p>Kill: To extinguish spiritual life: This refers to a spiritual death, leading individuals away from salvation and an abundant life with God. To destroy self-worth and faith: The devil’s actions can kill one’s self-worth or faith in God.</p>
<p>Destroy: To cause chaos and despair: His goal is to bring about total devastation, division, chaos, corruption, and despair in creation and human relationships. To make people give up: By creating terrible situations, the devil tries to weaken a person’s will and make them feel hopeless that their life is over.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jesus wants us to have spiritual peace, joy, meaning, and purpose, which are what the devil seeks to destroy.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I watched The Lion King. I felt like it was an allegory of God, Jesus or us and the devil. Scar (Satan) tempts Simba (us) to go somewhere he isn’t supposed to go. Then, once he goes and there are consequences, he holds the blame over Simba’s head. He makes him feel guilty and unworthy. Even blaming him for something he didn’t even do. If you feel that same kind of guilt, that’s not from God.</p>
<p>The Bible says in Isaiah 43:25:</p>
<p>NLT &#8211; “I – yes, I alone – will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.”</p>
<p>NKJV- “I will not remember your sins!”</p>
<p>If He tells us He won’t remember them, why should we? If we sin and repent, it’s under the blood.</p>
<img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21596" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-shame-on-you.jpg" width="300" />We need to hold negative thoughts captive (as I mentioned before) and remind the devil that Jesus paid it all “…having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross” (Colossians 2:14).</p>
<p>The Bible, good devotionals, Christian music, and reminding myself who I am in Christ help me remember not to allow guilt and shame to try to creep in. There are so many good songs that remind us that God doesn’t want us to be stuck in a pit of shame.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs is “Made for More” by Jenn Johnson, Bethel Music, and Josh Baldwin. These lyrics get me every time:</p>
<p><em>Cause I wasn’t made to be tending a grave</em><br />
<em>I was called by name</em><br />
<em>Born and raised back to life again</em><br />
<em>I was made for more</em><br />
<em>So why would I make a bed in my shame</em><br />
<em>When a fountain of grace is running my way</em><br />
<em>I know I am Yours</em><br />
<em>And I was made for more.</em>
<p>(“Made for More,” by Josh Baldwin, featuring Jenn Johnson, on Josh Baldwin, <em>Made for More</em>,  Bethel Music, 2024)</p>
<p>The enemy used to try to help me make “a bed of shame” before I knew better.</p>
<p>There are two Zach Williams songs that also have helped me. On his “Rescue Story” album there is a song called “Slave to Nothing” which says:</p>
<p><em>You can tell me what I did</em><br />
<em>You  can show me who I was before</em><br />
<em>Where I fell short</em><br />
<em>Hang it over my head</em><br />
<em>But I’m not the same anymore</em><br />
<em>One thing’s for sure</em><br />
<em>The shackles have fallen</em><br />
<em>So, I’m showing shame to the door</em><br />
<em>Make no mistake.</em><br />
<em>I’m a slave to nothing.</em></p>
<p>(“Slave to Nothing,” by Zach Williams, Track 5 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<p>I also love this one by Zach Williams: “Under My Feet”</p>
<p><em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>Those chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground</em><br />
<em>You can’t keep digging up my past</em><br />
<em>You may have had a laugh or two, but you don’t get the last</em><br />
<em>You might not recognize me now</em><br />
<em>[Chorus]</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was blind but now I see</em><br />
<em>Maybe I was bound but now I’m free</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>Maybe you’re a lie that I don’t need</em><br />
<em>Maybe you should listen when I speak</em><br />
<em>Maybe you need reminding</em><br />
<em>You’re under my feet</em><br />
<em>If you want scars, I’ll show you scars</em><br />
<em>All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the dark</em><br />
<em>If I were you, I’d be afraid</em><br />
<em>Cause everything you meant for guilt the cross has met with grace.</em></p>
<p>(“Under My Feet,” by Zach Williams, Track 6 from <em>Rescue Story</em>, Essential, 2019)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved son. For in the Son all our sins are canceled, and we have the release of redemption through his very blood.</em> – <strong>Colossians 1:13-14, TPT</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The NLT reads, “who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.”</p>
<p>Walsh puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>Shame tells us we are worthless. Christ says, “I have made you worthy.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we don’t belong. Christ says, “You are mine.” </em><br />
<em>Shame tells us we are dirty. Chris says, “I will wash you as white as snow.” </em>(p. 33).</p>
<p>If you struggle with guilt and shame, Christian counseling can help you deal with shame by providing a safe, non-judgmental space to get to the root causes from a faith-based perspective.</p>
<p>A counselor will use Bible-based principles, prayer, Scripture, and therapeutic approaches to help you reframe your self-image, find forgiveness, and develop a stronger relationship with God and others. The goal is to move past toxic shame by connecting with God’s grace and remember your identity in Christ.</p>
<p>So, back to “The Lion King.” When Nala finds the now adult Simba, she tells him he needs to come back to help take their home back from Scar. In the animated version, this conversation ensues between Simba and Rafiki:</p>
<p><strong>Simba:</strong> “I know what I have to do. But going back means I’ll have to face my past. I’ve been running from it for so long.”<br />

<title>8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I surveyed several different parents and asked them to share a piece of advice for parenting teenagers. The most common initial response that I received was “I don’t know if I’m the right person to ask, I don’t know if I’m doing it right!”</p>
<p>After engaging in several of these conversations, it became clear that many parents feel a sense of being unsure in parenting teenagers. If you are one of those parents, you are not alone in this feeling! The good news is that all the advice that follows is simple to do; not easy, but simple and straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>Love through establishing boundaries/rules</strong></p>
<p>Establishment of boundaries refers to teaching a child right from wrong and good from evil. This may sound entirely too simple, but the value of this is essential, not only for young children, but especially for teenagers who enter a world where they have access to evil and the ability to choose what is wrong.</p>
<p>The more one is exposed to evil, the more important it is to know the difference between good and evil. Ideally, this teaching begins at a young age and establishes early on the difference between good and evil, as well as the truth that parents establishing boundaries and saying “no” is out of love for the child.</p>
<p>It is no accident that one of the first interactions between God and Adam and Eve is to establish boundaries. He clearly tells them what they are to do and what they are not to do. He clearly states the consequences and then remains with them as they experience the pain of those consequences.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life" class="alignleft wp-image-57275" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Rules without relationship lead to rebellion</strong></p>
<p>Setting rules in place without the establishment and deepening of a relationship will lead to a teen rebelling against the rules. Rules feel like punishment when there is no trust that the one setting the rules is doing it for your good.</p>
<p>It is important to have the relationship in place from a young age, and it is just as important to deepen that relationship when children move into their teenage years. The following pieces of advice are a great place to start in establishing and deepening your relationship with your teenager.</p>
<p><strong>Be present and available</strong></p>
<p>As teenagers venture into the world, they do take on more responsibilities and practice independence in many ways. Parents naturally allow them to do more things without supervision. Maybe they begin to cook their own food, be at the house alone, work at a job outside of the home, supervise their siblings, or spend time with friends without the supervision of parents.</p>
<p>There is a good and natural move toward more independence. Part of that independence is the teenager learning to seek help when they need it, instead of parents initiating this. All of us know that we are much more likely to seek the help of another when they indicate to us that they are available. One thing that parents can do is signal their availability if their teen wants to engage with them.</p>
<p>Availability without expectation of engaging is often what the teens need to reach out for help. One parent that I spoke to shared that she will try to be up when she knows that her teenager is up, in the few minutes before her teenager leaves the house for the day, just in case her teenager wants to talk through things.</p>
<p>This parent also shared that she would make sure that the radio is off when driving in the vehicle with her teen to leave open the opportunity for conversation. A teen often feels more comfortable speaking with an adult when some of the pressures of face-to-face conversations are lessened.</p>
<p><strong>Listen</strong></p>
<img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life 1" class="alignright wp-image-57276" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />This was the first piece of advice that a teenager gave me when I asked about good advice for parents of teenagers. She said that many of her friends have told her that they do not feel listened to by their parents. Often, interactions between parents and their teenagers can be emotional and tense. Moments like these make it difficult for any true listening to take place.</p>
<p>The important part of listening is being aware of how one is listening. One can listen to prepare their response, or one can listen to hear and understand the other person. In general, one feels most listened to when the other person is listening to understand and hear what the other person is saying.</p>
<p>One easy skill to bolster listening skills is to do what we call reflecting back. This is simple. You repeat the words that they just said back to the person. If done in a caring and genuine way, it allows the other person to trust that you are listening to them.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong>
<p>As teenagers move into the more adult and independent world, they need support and encouragement. The teenage years are often full of teens taking chances and being vulnerable as they stumble through choices in the adult world. The funny thing about teenagers is that they often hide their own insecurities as they step into this new world.</p>
<p>Though it is often hidden, the insecurities are there. It can be reassuring to receive encouragement as small successes are achieved. An easy phrase that means the world to teenagers is a genuine “I’m proud of you.” Teenagers long for some assurance that they are doing well in the adult world. They might present a self-assured attitude, but underneath, there is insecurity and longing for support.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57277" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Show care</strong></p>
<p>One of the most impactful statements from a young teenager that I interviewed was the following: “Don’t forget that we are still kids, we aren’t adults yet. We need parents to still take care of us and help us.” As teenagers enter the adult world, they can appear mature or project certainty even when they don’t feel mature or certain.</p>
<p>This can make it difficult for their parents to know how to help and care for them. My advice would be to fall back on basics. Check in on how your teenager is sleeping. Support a healthy bedtime routine. Check in on eating habits. Offer to prepare nourishing snacks or meals. Check in on emotional connections with others. Offer some one-on-one time with your teenager to talk about stresses or concerns. Continue to offer affection through physical touch.</p>
<p>This can feel awkward as your teenager grows into their adult body. This is needed now, more than ever. Continue to offer hugs, high fives, fist pumps, etc. Offer a pat on the back or your arm around their shoulder. Teenagers crave this connection, especially when their bodies might feel uncomfortable as they change with the onset of puberty. Continued physical affection from parents can allow a teenager to feel comfortable and confident in their own body.</p>
<p><strong>Dream big</strong></p>
<p>Encourage your teenager to dream big and not limit themselves. It feels safest to do what other people are doing or to only pursue things that are known and familiar. Encouraging your teenager to imagine bigger than what they know communicates two things to your teenager. The first thing it communicates is that you have confidence in the capacity and abilities of your teenager.</p>
<p>The second thing that it communicates is that the Lord has a plan for your teen that is much greater than your own. Ultimately, your teenager must learn to listen to the Lord and follow Him, without the voices of others getting too loud. This truth can also take some of the pressure that parents feel about having to figure out what their teenager plans to do with their life.</p>
<p><strong>Apologize</strong></p>
<img alt="8 Pieces of Advice For Parenting Teenagers That Will Change Your Life 3" class="alignright wp-image-57278" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/8-pieces-of-advice-for-parenting-teenagers-that-will-change-your-life-4-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Every relationship between humans involves rupture. A disconnection between two people. In healthy relationships, the rupture is followed by repair. The repair is a reconnection. Many times, the repair begins with an apology. Not only does this serve as the beginning of repair, but it is also how one takes responsibility for one&#8217;s own reactions and responses.</p>
<p>Discussions between parents and their teenagers can often get emotional. When words or tone of voice from the parent become disrespectful or hurtful, it is so important for the parent to apologize to their teenager about this.</p>
<p>It is always important for all of us to take responsibility for our words and actions. The age-old adage is true – kids care more about what adults do than what they say. When teenagers observe their parents apologizing and are at the receiving end of this, they learn how to do this themselves.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have shared eight different pieces of advice that I received from parents and teenagers about parenting teenagers. Although I cannot guarantee that these pieces of advice will change your life, I can guarantee that if these pieces of advice are taken to heart and implemented in your relationship with your teenager, it will deepen and strengthen your relationship with your teenager.</p>
<p>Deepening and strengthening a relationship with a teenager and parent will not just change those lives, but the lives of others in their family, and every life that your teenager meets. As Mother Teresa once said, “If you want to change the world, go home and love your family.”</p>

<title>Helping Highly Conflicted Couples Through Christian Couples Therapy</title>
<link>https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/articles/helping-highly-conflicted-couples-through-christian-couples-therapy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/?p=57265</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:09:43 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It seems to me that we are surrounded by conflict: financial, political, family, personal, mechanical, and digital. Conflict, I think, is a byproduct of a fallen world.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. –</em> <strong>James 4:</strong><strong>1-3</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This week, I have a larger-than-usual list of couples experiencing significant conflicts. Why do we end up in conflict with those who are particularly important to us? Most couples say they love each other, but have a tough time communicating love and compassion</p>
<h3>What the Bible Says</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful</em>. – <strong>Colossians 3:12-14</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Most people would like to be at peace. At least that&#8217;s what we say. I have noticed that there are times when I simply want my own way, and I don’t like the way things are. I lose sight of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>We have everything we need: money, opportunity, a lovely home, and children, and yet we’re not happy if we don’t have peace in our marriage. I feel excited at the prospect of helping new couples and working through the challenges ahead, but high-conflict couples can sometimes strain my capabilities.</p>
<p>Highly conflicted couples are often engaged in intense power struggles, each trying to get something from their mate, yet doing so in ways that create the problem. They demand, blame, punish, and coerce, hardly noticing their actions are fueling the fire.</p>
<img alt="Helping Highly Conflicted Couples Through Christian Couples Therapy" class="alignleft wp-image-57266" height="169" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helping-highly-conflicted-couples-through-christian-couples-therapy-500x281.jpg" width="300" />Fortunately, Author and psychologist Marshall Rosenberg wrote in his book, Nonviolent Communication, that highly conflicted couples are trapped in power struggles with one another.</p>
<p>He suggests that people use “life-alienating language” filled with judgments about rightness and wrongness, goodness and badness, judgment, diagnosis, and self-righteousness, without hearing the values that the other holds. Couples who try to control each other end up in conflict, whereas couples who accept one another are much more likely to connect.</p>
<h3>Common Dynamics of Highly Conflicted Couples</h3>
<p>Highly conflicted couples often find themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locked into oppositional stances</li>
<li>Frequently angry with one another</li>
<li>Poor conflict-resolution/communication skills</li>
<li>Poor impulse control</li>
<li>Tend to blame and fault-find</li>
<li>Have rigidly held beliefs about their partner</li>
<li>Offering little insight into their contribution to their problems</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find yourself doing these things, here are a few suggestions on how to work your way out of that.</p>
<p><strong>Change the focus</strong>
<p>When a couple is struggling, they often come into a meeting with a list of complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe the Conversation</strong></p>
<p>Reframe the conversation away from being about what their spouse is or isn’t doing to thinking about their relationship bond.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love– </em><strong>1 John 4:7-8</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Create positive interactions</strong></p>
<p>It’s much easier to do something positive than to work through all the negative.. What can you do to build your connection?”</p>
<p>Questions to ask: What do you do that improves your bond? What do you do that tears down your bond? What will be the impact on your bond if you continue in these behaviors? What are you willing to do to improve?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! – </em><strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Increase validation</strong></p>
<p>Try to understand what is really going on with each other, listen to thoughts and feelings, and validate one another. To really understand each other, we need to uncover each other&#8217;s emotional needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” – </em><strong>Galatians 5:14</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Recognize emotional triggers</strong></p>
<p>Emotional triggers are what frequently fuel many of our conflicts. Our spouse says something, and it triggers us. It is easier to be compassionate and to have empathy for your partner. If you understand that you are reacting that way because that’s the way your dad reacted, often our reactions are messages from Our Childhood</p>
<p><strong>Identify conflict patterns</strong></p>
<p>Couples often seek help because they are fighting; conflict is not usually about solving the problem, it is about how you treat one another.</p>
<p><strong>Build intimacy</strong></p>
<p>Three topics usually lead to a couple conflict: communication, conflict management, and physical intimacy. So much of what needs to happen for couples is to simply have a safe environment where they can talk about their needs, their wants, what is working, and how they might want to increase the intimacy in the bedroom</p>
<p><strong>Process resentment</strong></p>
<p>Resentment can build up over time. At the core of resentment is not being able to forgive. We hold the hurts and pains internally, and then they pop up again and impact our current relationship. Sometimes, resentment and unforgiveness build up over time.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a process. It looks like this: It is a choice, you can feel hurt, but you choose not to hold on to the hurt. You don’t just forget, but we learn to trust again. We develop compassion for our loved ones, and we let go of bitterness. We don’t emotionally shut down</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. </em></p>
<p><em>And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things. – </em><strong>Philippians 4:4-8</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>To conclude. I suggest we pray for each other and focus on helping our spouse be better. Give with no expectation of getting back. Marriage is not <em>quid pro quo</em>. If you remember your vows, there were no caveats. No “if-then” clauses. There were promises “till death parts us.”</p>
<p>These are sacred, and God will help us with them. If you are struggling, take some serious time to pray, find a counselor, a pastor, or a Christian friend. In my experience, everything changes over time. Give God some time to make it better, and watch it change and get better. Every change changes everything.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The fear of abandonment can develop in early childhood or later in life. When someone you love and is supposed to love you leaves, it etches a silent message to your mind: I’m unloved, unwanted, and not worthy of attention.</p>
<p>These messages could not be further from the truth. The Bible states that God knew you from before you were born. He created you and already had a plan for your life from before your birth.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well…Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.</em> <strong>– Psalm 139:13-14, 16, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Your worth is not the result of another person’s actions. God will never leave you nor forsake you. He is faithful, and His mercy endures forever. You can lay the fear of abandonment at His feet.</p>
<h3>Tips for Overcoming the Fear of Abandonment</h3>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment.jpg"><img alt="fear of abandonment " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-64181" height="199" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment.jpg" width="300" /></a>It is possible to overcome the fear of abandonment, but it will take time for healing and to replace negative thoughts and limiting beliefs. You may still have days when you question your own worth. However, with the right type of counseling, you will develop healthy coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>Don’t allow the fear of abandonment to flow through your family. You can break the generational cycle by addressing your anxiety now. Healing your heart and allowing Jesus to take the place of any person will overflow onto your children and grandchildren, leaving behind a legacy of healing and love.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t hide from your feelings</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge your feelings and have a safe space to express the hurt, anger, and frustration. Coming to terms with what happened does not mean that you are at fault. Instead, it is a part of the healing process. Unprocessed emotions can manifest into physical and mental conditions and create trouble in other relationships.</p>
<p>Journaling is an effective tool for expressing your thoughts and feelings. It allows you to write on the page what you would like to say to the other person. Having an outlet for these emotions helps you to move past them as you live your life. Don’t hide from your feelings. Express them on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Work on negative thoughts and limiting beliefs</strong></p>
<p>Abandonment embeds negative thoughts and limiting beliefs into the psyche. For example, you may carry the hateful words someone you love spoke to you. These words become part of your narrative and your belief system. If they stated that no one would love you, then you might believe no one will ever love you. This thought pattern can cause self-sabotage in relationships.</p>
<p>Identifying negative thoughts and limiting beliefs is the first step. Using a journal or small notebook, jot down every thought that brings you emotional pain or self-sabotage. Catch these thoughts and challenge them.</p>
<p>Are these factual statements, or simply the regurgitation of someone bitter and hurting? Have you surmised these beliefs based on this person’s actions? Ask a counselor to help you identify and replace negative thoughts and limiting beliefs with more helpful ones.</p>
<p><strong>Nurture meaningful relationships</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-2.jpg"><img alt="fear of abandonment " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-86108" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-2.jpg" width="300" /></a>When someone you love leaves, you might wonder if it’s worth the effort to invite others into your circle. No one wants to be hurt again. Yet, there is no proof that you will or will not be hurt again. People are human. We are all flawed. However, what we can do is form meaningful relationships and nurture them to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>We can let people in and take a chance. What relationships should you nurture? The people who have stuck by you, or the new person in town, or at your church. Find common ground with them and ask God to give you discernment to let the right ones in for His glory and your peace.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to set boundaries</strong></p>
<p>If you have faced the fear of abandonment, then you may fall into the people-pleasing rut. You want to feel love and acceptance, so you bend your rules and values for other people. You allow others to take advantage of your kindness and generosity. Although we should always approach people with love and kindness, we must set boundaries to protect our peace and mental health.</p>
<p>Make it clear about people’s access to you. There will be people you need to forgive, but you cannot make them a daily part of your life due to past hurts or betrayals. Set boundaries with those in your life. Identify the behaviors you will not tolerate and clearly communicate them to others.</p>
<p><strong>Make honest communication a priority</strong></p>
<p>Keep communication open with the people who matter the most to you. Honest communication can often be emotionally draining during difficult conversations, but maintaining open lines of communication can lead to forgiveness and healing.</p>
<p>Don’t feel like a solution must be found right away. Take a breather and question whether you may be falling back into old behavioral patterns due to abandonment issues. Speak with a counselor if you need to develop your communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>Consider talk therapy</strong></p>
<p>It’s easy to lie to ourselves. We tell ourselves a story to make life bearable while we deal with the fear of abandonment. Talk therapy is an excellent format for uncovering the root cause of anxiety and finding ways to manage the thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>A counselor leads talk therapy and provides you with a safe space to express your pain and the thoughts and emotions that are holding you back. This is also an opportunity to discuss negative thoughts and limiting beliefs, and learn healthy coping mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Research Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong></p>
<p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a method that helps break negative thoughts and emotions, reframing them into healthier ones, thereby changing behaviors. CBT also works in reverse. When you identify an unhealthy or harmful behavior, CBT helps you change not only the behavior itself but also the thoughts associated with it and the resulting emotions.</p>
<p>You will need to see a mental health professional to begin CBT. CBT is effective for helping people with various mental conditions, including anxiety, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and eating disorders.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-3.jpg"><img alt="Christian Counseling " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-86109" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-abandonment-3.jpg" width="300" /></a><strong>Turn your story into a testimony in group therapy</strong></p>
<p>Although it is painful, everyone has a story to tell. You don’t know how much your story of abandonment or neglect may impact another life. Turn your story into a testimony and seek support and encouragement from others in group therapy.</p>
<p>You can often find group therapy at local counseling centers, community centers, hospitals, and online. Many people like a virtual option, where they can participate from the comfort of their own home while engaging with others.</p>
<p><strong>Take time out for yourself</strong></p>
<p>If you struggle with abandonment issues, you may find yourself giving more to others than to yourself. This is a natural response to the fear of abandonment. You are afraid that if you do not please others, they might leave.</p>
<p>But you cannot pour from an empty cup. Eventually, you will burn out. Taking time out for yourself is not selfish; it’s self-care. It’s protecting your peace and health, so that you can be there for others. Think of activities that make you happy or leave you with a sense of accomplishment. Some suggestions include going for a long walk, visiting a park or museum, or curling up with a good book. Try to do something specifically for you once or twice a day.</p>

<title>Forgiving Others: Why It’s Important to Our Health</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>People struggle with the concept of forgiveness. The human question, “Why should I even bother to forgive?” is prevalent in our society, and it’s a difficult one. When Jesus told his disciples to forgive 70&#215;7 times, he was commanding them to go against their instinct to hold a grudge. It’s easier to stay angry than it is to forgive, but it’s not better for us.</p>
<h3>What happens when we forgive?</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we let go of the resentment or desire for revenge, even though the hurt may remain. Physically, our brain feels more empathy, compassion, and understanding. The amygdala, which processes our fear response, is downgraded, and the pain network in our brain is deactivated.</p>
<p>The pain network can be associated with grievances, and deactivating it lowers stress hormone levels, which contributes to overall physical health and builds resilience. The prefrontal cortex also engages, leading to better self-control and the ability to focus on positive future pursuits instead of dwelling on the pain from the past (Ricciardi et al., 2013).</p>
<h3>Why Forgiveness Matters</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we feel better, not because we are letting the person who hurt us off the hook, but because we are taking away their power to hurt us. We are not telling them that their actions or abuse are okay, because they are not. But we are letting go of vengeance and leaving it to God.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others against their sins, your father will not forgive your sins.” – </em><strong>Matthew 6:14-15, ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Physically, not holding onto a grudge has positive effects as well. According to a study done by Johns Hopkins, when you release the anger and regulate emotions, it can lead to lower blood pressure, cortisol levels (which contribute to stubborn belly fat that won’t let go), and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Choosing to forgive can also lower cholesterol levels, improve sleep, and reduce physical pain.</p>
<h3>Historical Example</h3>
<p>Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch Christian woman who lived in the Netherlands during the Nazi Occupation. She helped children with special needs learn how to read and write and was outspoken about her faith. She lived with her father, Kasper, and her sister Elizabeth (Betsy).</p>
<p>When the laws discriminating against Jews were implemented, she and her family decided to take a stand. They built a fake wall up in her bedroom to hide Jewish citizens until they could get fake passports and smuggle them out of the country. She even had connections in the social services office to get more food ration tickets.</p>
<p>Their plan worked well for a while until a man by the name of Jan Vogel tricked her and turned the family over. They were able to hide the Jews and keep them safe, but the Ten Boom Family was arrested. Kasper died, and Corrie and Betsy were sent to Ravensbrück, where the conditions were deplorable. Their cabin had lice, which Betsy told Corrie to count as a blessing because the lice kept the guards from coming near.</p>
<p>They were forced to line up and work hard to the point where Betsy eventually passed away after the strenuous labor. Corrie held resentment for years until she came face-to-face with the man who betrayed her.</p>
<p>It was then that she said the Lord reminded her that if Jesus could forgive her for any of her sins, she could forgive the man who betrayed her. She reported finding freedom in that moment and traveled the world talking about the spiritual benefits of forgiveness (2023).</p>
<h3>The Cost of Unforgiveness</h3>
<p>According to an article by Johns Hopkins, forgiveness can lead to many positive effects on the body. Studies have found that when a person refuses to remain bitter, they have a lower risk of heart attacks, better cholesterol levels, lower amounts of pain, better blood pressure, lower anxiety, depression, and stress.</p>
<img alt="Forgiving Others: Why It's Important to Our Health 1" class="alignleft wp-image-44186" height="169" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/forgiving-others-why-its-important-to-our-health-2-500x281.jpg" width="300" />When a person refuses to forgive, they willingly put themselves in chronic fight-or-flight mode, which spikes their cortisol, lowers their immune response, and can raise blood pressure and heart rate, which could eventually lead to a heart attack. A lack of forgiveness could also contribute to diabetes. Forgiveness, however, calms stress levels (2024).</p>
<h3>Forgiveness as a Process</h3>
<p>It is easy to tell somebody that they are forgiven, but sometimes the actions do not line up with their words, and that is because to forgive, a person needs to put down their pride and their hurt.</p>
<p>When Jesus told his disciples to forgive seventy times seven times, it was to demonstrate that the process of forgiveness is ongoing and does not just stop. People will disappoint us, and in each disappointment, we have a choice: let the disappointment take over and change the way we see the person or choose to forgive.</p>
<p>Forgiveness unfolds in stages: acknowledging the pain, grieving, and choosing release. And because people are inherently flawed, this is a process that needs to be repeated.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis, Joseph was raised well by his family. He was the first child that Rachel conceived when his parents thought conception was impossible. His father, Jacob, spoiled him, giving him everything, and that made his brothers jealous, so rather than showing compassion or understanding, they let their bitterness and jealousy overcome them and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>Joseph had favor in the eyes of God and was sold to a wealthy Egyptian named Potiphar. He worked his way up in Potiphar’s household and caught the attention of Potiphar’s wife. She tried to convince him to sleep with her, and when he refused, she accused him of rape, which resulted in Joseph being arrested and thrown in prison.</p>
<p>But God helped Joseph to interpret dreams for two other prisoners. One of the prisoners was set free and eventually remembered Joseph’s ability to interpret dreams at a time when Pharaoh was plagued with dreams. Joseph was sent for.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s God-given wisdom got him out of prison, and he became the second most powerful man in Egypt. He worked to prepare Egypt for a famine that was to come in seven years.</p>
<p>Seven years later, Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt to buy food. Though they did not recognize him, Joseph recognized them. He first tested them to see if they had truly changed, accusing them of theft, but eventually he revealed his identity and demonstrated forgiveness. He told them that God brought him there to preserve their lives and future generations. Then he brought his family to live with him in Egypt.</p>
<p>He recognized that all the pain they caused would be used for good. He told them that what they meant for evil God turned to good, as He does for all of those who love Him.</p>
<h3>Boundaries and Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Forgiveness does not mean that reconciliation needs to occur. When abuse is present, the safety of the abused is more important than the relationship. It is important to forgive while still maintaining boundaries, meaning that some tough questions may need to be asked, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long has this person been in my life?</li>
<li>What is my relationship with them?</li>
<li>Why do I feel obligated to have them in my life, or why should I cut them out?</li>
<li>How often have they hurt me? Is this a pattern? If so, can I let go?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may also determine that while they have forgiven the person who hurt them, they don’t feel comfortable seeing them frequently, or alone. Perhaps the hurt person decides that they only want to see them during family events, or in public outings to see if the perpetrator’s behaviors have changed (Kail, 2020).</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Forgiveness is a process with many benefits and zero harm in doing it. Forgiveness does not absolve the person of what they did but rather takes away the perpetrator’s ability to continuously and actively harm somebody. It is taking away the power to make the victim angry.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not always mean reconciliation, and in cases of abuse, reconciliation is not recommended unless the abuser goes through therapy and shows true life change. Even then, it is up to the discretion of the person who was abused.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a choice that every person must make every day. Sometimes it’s for trivial things like mean words, other times it’s for situations that cause damage to multiple people. Either way, forgiveness is needed, and sometimes we need forgiveness even more than we need to forgive.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” – </em><strong>Luke 23:34, NIV</strong></blockquote>

<p>Forgiveness is a process with many benefits and zero harm in doing it. Forgiveness does not absolve the person of what they did but rather takes away the perpetrator’s ability to continuously and actively harm somebody. It is taking away the power to make the victim angry.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not always mean reconciliation, and in cases of abuse, reconciliation is not recommended unless the abuser goes through therapy and shows true life change. Even then, it is up to the discretion of the person who was abused.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a choice that every person must make every day. Sometimes it’s for trivial things like mean words, other times it’s for situations that cause damage to multiple people. Either way, forgiveness is needed, and sometimes we need forgiveness even more than we need to forgive.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>People struggle with the concept of forgiveness. The human question, “Why should I even bother to forgive?” is prevalent in our society, and it’s a difficult one. When Jesus told his disciples to forgive 70&#215;7 times, he was commanding them to go against their instinct to hold a grudge. It’s easier to stay angry than it is to forgive, but it’s not better for us.</p>
<h3>What happens when we forgive?</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we let go of the resentment or desire for revenge, even though the hurt may remain. Physically, our brain feels more empathy, compassion, and understanding. The amygdala, which processes our fear response, is downgraded, and the pain network in our brain is deactivated.</p>
<p>The pain network can be associated with grievances, and deactivating it lowers stress hormone levels, which contributes to overall physical health and builds resilience. The prefrontal cortex also engages, leading to better self-control and the ability to focus on positive future pursuits instead of dwelling on the pain from the past (Ricciardi et al., 2013).</p>
<h3>Why Forgiveness Matters</h3>
<p>When we forgive, we feel better, not because we are letting the person who hurt us off the hook, but because we are taking away their power to hurt us. We are not telling them that their actions or abuse are okay, because they are not. But we are letting go of vengeance and leaving it to God.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others against their sins, your father will not forgive your sins.” – </em><strong>Matthew 6:14-15, ESV</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Physically, not holding onto a grudge has positive effects as well. According to a study done by Johns Hopkins, when you release the anger and regulate emotions, it can lead to lower blood pressure, cortisol levels (which contribute to stubborn belly fat that won’t let go), and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Choosing to forgive can also lower cholesterol levels, improve sleep, and reduce physical pain.</p>
<h3>Historical Example</h3>
<p>Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch Christian woman who lived in the Netherlands during the Nazi Occupation. She helped children with special needs learn how to read and write and was outspoken about her faith. She lived with her father, Kasper, and her sister Elizabeth (Betsy).</p>
<p>When the laws discriminating against Jews were implemented, she and her family decided to take a stand. They built a fake wall up in her bedroom to hide Jewish citizens until they could get fake passports and smuggle them out of the country. She even had connections in the social services office to get more food ration tickets.</p>
<p>Their plan worked well for a while until a man by the name of Jan Vogel tricked her and turned the family over. They were able to hide the Jews and keep them safe, but the Ten Boom Family was arrested. Kasper died, and Corrie and Betsy were sent to Ravensbrück, where the conditions were deplorable. Their cabin had lice, which Betsy told Corrie to count as a blessing because the lice kept the guards from coming near.</p>
<p>They were forced to line up and work hard to the point where Betsy eventually passed away after the strenuous labor. Corrie held resentment for years until she came face-to-face with the man who betrayed her.</p>
<p>It was then that she said the Lord reminded her that if Jesus could forgive her for any of her sins, she could forgive the man who betrayed her. She reported finding freedom in that moment and traveled the world talking about the spiritual benefits of forgiveness (2023).</p>
<h3>The Cost of Unforgiveness</h3>
<p>According to an article by Johns Hopkins, forgiveness can lead to many positive effects on the body. Studies have found that when a person refuses to remain bitter, they have a lower risk of heart attacks, better cholesterol levels, lower amounts of pain, better blood pressure, lower anxiety, depression, and stress.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/forgiving-others-why-its-important-to-our-health.jpg"><img alt="forgiving others " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-51484" height="169" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/forgiving-others-why-its-important-to-our-health.jpg" width="300" /></a>When a person refuses to forgive, they willingly put themselves in chronic fight-or-flight mode, which spikes their cortisol, lowers their immune response, and can raise blood pressure and heart rate, which could eventually lead to a heart attack. A lack of forgiveness could also contribute to diabetes. Forgiveness, however, calms stress levels (2024).</p>
<h3>Forgiveness as a Process</h3>
<p>It is easy to tell somebody that they are forgiven, but sometimes the actions do not line up with their words, and that is because to forgive, a person needs to put down their pride and their hurt.</p>
<p>When Jesus told his disciples to forgive seventy times seven times, it was to demonstrate that the process of forgiveness is ongoing and does not just stop. People will disappoint us, and in each disappointment, we have a choice: let the disappointment take over and change the way we see the person or choose to forgive.</p>
<p>Forgiveness unfolds in stages: acknowledging the pain, grieving, and choosing release. And because people are inherently flawed, this is a process that needs to be repeated.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis, Joseph was raised well by his family. He was the first child that Rachel conceived when his parents thought conception was impossible. His father, Jacob, spoiled him, giving him everything, and that made his brothers jealous, so rather than showing compassion or understanding, they let their bitterness and jealousy overcome them and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>Joseph had favor in the eyes of God and was sold to a wealthy Egyptian named Potiphar. He worked his way up in Potiphar’s household and caught the attention of Potiphar’s wife. She tried to convince him to sleep with her, and when he refused, she accused him of rape, which resulted in Joseph being arrested and thrown in prison.</p>
<p>But God helped Joseph to interpret dreams for two other prisoners. One of the prisoners was set free and eventually remembered Joseph’s ability to interpret dreams at a time when Pharaoh was plagued with dreams. Joseph was sent for.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s God-given wisdom got him out of prison, and he became the second most powerful man in Egypt. He worked to prepare Egypt for a famine that was to come in seven years.</p>
<p>Seven years later, Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt to buy food. Though they did not recognize him, Joseph recognized them. He first tested them to see if they had truly changed, accusing them of theft, but eventually he revealed his identity and demonstrated forgiveness. He told them that God brought him there to preserve their lives and future generations. Then he brought his family to live with him in Egypt.</p>
<p>He recognized that all the pain they caused would be used for good. He told them that what they meant for evil God turned to good, as He does for all of those who love Him.</p>
<h3>Boundaries and Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Forgiveness does not mean that reconciliation needs to occur. When abuse is present, the safety of the abused is more important than the relationship. It is important to forgive while still maintaining boundaries, meaning that some tough questions may need to be asked, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long has this person been in my life?</li>
<li>What is my relationship with them?</li>
<li>Why do I feel obligated to have them in my life, or why should I cut them out?</li>
<li>How often have they hurt me? Is this a pattern? If so, can I let go?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may also determine that while they have forgiven the person who hurt them, they don’t feel comfortable seeing them frequently, or alone. Perhaps the hurt person decides that they only want to see them during family events, or in public outings to see if the perpetrator’s behaviors have changed (Kail, 2020).</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Forgiveness is a process with many benefits and zero harm in doing it. Forgiveness does not absolve the person of what they did but rather takes away the perpetrator’s ability to continuously and actively harm somebody. It is taking away the power to make the victim angry.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not always mean reconciliation, and in cases of abuse, reconciliation is not recommended unless the abuser goes through therapy and shows true life change. Even then, it is up to the discretion of the person who was abused.</p>

<title>When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Many people think Christians never get angry, or if they become angry, they shouldn’t stay angry. Anger is a strong response to something displeasing. Jesus says, “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33), meaning there will be struggles during our life’s path.</p>
<img alt="When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment 1" class="alignleft wp-image-44157" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-2-333x500.jpg" width="200" />God also says that vengeance belongs to Him (Romans 12:19). God takes on the actionable part of anger because He knows the spiritual, emotional, and physical costs associated with anger. Responses vary depending on the situation and the person, but it’s natural to have some type of response when you feel you’ve been dealt an injustice.</p>
<p>Your anger response lets others know that you’re angry and to what degree, especially if they know you well. And though these responses must manifest respectfully to avoid violence and toxic behavior, communicating your feelings to whom the anger is directed can bring some relief, open communication, and possibly be a step toward resolution.</p>
<p>But what happens when the person you’re angry at isn’t there to talk to? What if the person you want to hang up on never calls? What if the person you want to yell at is in the grave? What if all this anger is pent up inside of you with no hope of release?</p>
<h3>Should Christians get angry?</h3>
<p>There is a widely accepted belief that Christians should not get angry. Those who hold this view often quote the Bible’s teachings about being slow to anger, being peacemakers, and being long-suffering. It’s unlikely that any Christian would counter that argument. But we aren’t robots either. We were created with feelings.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks quite a bit about anger, but it doesn’t say that we shouldn’t feel it. Feeling angry is a natural human emotion. Even Christ Himself felt righteous anger at the moneychangers in the temple. He overturned their tables in His wrath. The Bible doesn’t condemn anger as an emotion, but gives us guidelines about how to handle it.</p>
<p>“In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.” (Ephesians 4:26-27, NIV). This means that we will feel anger, but it’s what we do with that anger that matters.</p>
<h3>How should Christians respond?</h3>
<p>If it’s inevitable, even condoned, that you will feel anger, how should you respond? The Bible tells us to be slow to speak and slow to anger (James 1:19, NIV). All of our reactive responses, like slammed doors and yelling, might not align with God’s Word. If we feel anger welling up inside, it is best to take control of that feeling, examine the true source of the anger, and then respond with godly action.</p>
<p><img alt="When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment 2" class="alignright wp-image-44158" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-3-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Godly action means turning your anger over to God. You use prayer and Scripture to guide you to a resolution. Is this a righteous anger, selfish, or sin-based? Ask yourself if you are being motivated by justice and a love for God, as Jesus was in the temple, or are you angry out of selfish motives? Whatever the motivation driving your anger, as a Christian, you need to be quick to forgive and speak your truth gently to avoid stirring up more anger. (Proverbs 15:1)</p>
<p>Being a Christian doesn’t make you a pushover; it gives you guidelines toward a righteous and godly resolution. That often comes in the form of a difficult conversation or establishing boundaries. You might have to tell someone how they’ve hurt you or insist on a set of rules to protect your peace.</p>
<h3>But what if you can’t talk it out?</h3>
<p>If you’re holding anger toward someone who has blocked you, ghosted you, moved, put a restraining order on you, or has died, you might wonder if the feelings inside of you will ever be satisfied. You might long to have a conversation with them, detailing how they mistreated you or explaining how you feel misunderstood.</p>
<p>But if they aren’t available to receive this information or to interact, you might be left with a tightly wound ball of anger and frustration. In counseling, there’s a technique called the empty chair technique. This technique allows an individual to identify and vocalize difficult emotions such as anger.</p>
<p>An individual speaks to an empty chair, visualizing that there is an individual actually occupying the chair. This technique provides a safe space for emotional expression, insight, and awareness. It can begin to allow greater space for healing and self-discovery.</p>
<p>While you might not be able to spill your heart or explain your feelings to a loved one who has passed away or justify your actions to an ex who has you blocked, you can still get that anger out in a productive way.</p>
<p>If you take the time to carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly pour your emotions out, your brain will have nearly the same benefit as it would if you were having the conversation with the person you’re angry with. This can bring the peace you are looking for. Here are some additional ways you can release the anger you hold inside.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment 3" class="alignleft wp-image-44159" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-4-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Prayer</strong>
<p>Prayer is a wonderful way to get that anger out of your heart and head and into the hands of God. Sometimes people think of prayer simply as a laundry list of wants or a formality, but prayer really is a conversation. If you’re feeling angry about something, tell God. Tell God your side of the story, ask for His intervention and peace, and dive into Scripture for further direction. As you’re praying, begin to visualize how you want your life to look when you’re feeling less angry.</p>
<p>Releasing your pent-up thoughts and describing the injustices that have been dealt to you is healing. And what better audience than your loving Heavenly Father, who just so happens to hold the power of the universe in His hands.</p>
<p><strong>Journaling</strong></p>
<p>If you have never tried journaling, you might be surprised at the benefits. If you’re angry at someone you don’t have access to, write it down. Spend as much time as you need, weeks, months even, to lay each feeling down on paper. Recall the incident that made you feel uncomfortable, unheard, or misunderstood. Tell your side of the story.</p>
<p>Journaling forces you to organize your thoughts and slows down your brain processing long enough to find reason and clarity. Write a letter, even if you never send it. Telling your story can sometimes be enough to satisfy your anger, even if no one else will ever hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong></p>
<p>While nothing can replace God’s intervention and peaceful presence, therapy can help you with unresolved anger. Through roleplay and learning about other emotions underneath anger, you can explain your perspective, communicate your anger, and untangle the intricacies of your relationships and situations</p>
<p>A Christian therapist can identify Scriptures and share biblical truths that apply directly to your circumstances. This process will not only give you the satisfaction of being heard but will also provide you with an ally who can share coping skills to get you on the road to recovery.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="When Anger Leaves a Trail: Steps Toward Confession, Healing, and Empowerment" class="alignright wp-image-44156" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-500x334.jpg" width="300" />Forgiveness</strong></p>
<p>While you might never get the apology you’re looking for or have the opportunity to explain your side of the story, you can still forgive. Not by your own limited human abilities but through the never-ending, abundant grace of God. Even if you don’t want to forgive, you can still apply the blood of Jesus to your anger and leave it in His trustworthy hands. Soon, your heart will soften, and peace will grow where anger once lived.</p>

<p>If you have never tried journaling, you might be surprised at the benefits. If you’re angry at someone you don’t have access to, write it down. Spend as much time as you need, weeks, months even, to lay each feeling down on paper. Recall the incident that made you feel uncomfortable, unheard, or misunderstood. Tell your side of the story.</p>
<p>Journaling forces you to organize your thoughts and slows down your brain processing long enough to find reason and clarity. Write a letter, even if you never send it. Telling your story can sometimes be enough to satisfy your anger, even if no one else will ever hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong></p>
<p>While nothing can replace God’s intervention and peaceful presence, therapy can help you with unresolved anger. Through roleplay and learning about other emotions underneath anger, you can explain your perspective, communicate your anger, and untangle the intricacies of your relationships and situations</p>
<p>A Christian therapist can identify Scriptures and share biblical truths that apply directly to your circumstances. This process will not only give you the satisfaction of being heard but will also provide you with an ally who can share coping skills to get you on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>While you might never get the apology you’re looking for or have the opportunity to explain your side of the story, you can still forgive. Not by your own limited human abilities but through the never-ending, abundant grace of God. Even if you don’t want to forgive, you can still apply the blood of Jesus to your anger and leave it in His trustworthy hands. Soon, your heart will soften, and peace will grow where anger once lived.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Many people think Christians never get angry, or if they become angry, they shouldn’t stay angry. Anger is a strong response to something displeasing. Jesus says, “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33), meaning there will be struggles during our life’s path.</p>
<p>God also says that vengeance belongs to Him (Romans 12:19). God takes on the actionable part of anger because He knows the spiritual, emotional, and physical costs associated with anger. Responses vary depending on the situation and the person, but it’s natural to have some type of response when you feel you’ve been dealt an injustice.</p>
<p>Your anger response lets others know that you’re angry and to what degree, especially if they know you well. And though these responses must manifest respectfully to avoid violence and toxic behavior, communicating your feelings to whom the anger is directed can bring some relief, open communication, and possibly be a step toward resolution.</p>
<p>But what happens when the person you’re angry at isn’t there to talk to? What if the person you want to hang up on never calls? What if the person you want to yell at is in the grave? What if all this anger is pent up inside of you with no hope of release?</p>
<h3>Should Christians get angry?</h3>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment.jpg"><img alt="anger" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-58471" height="300" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment.jpg" width="200" /></a>There is a widely accepted belief that Christians should not get angry. Those who hold this view often quote the Bible’s teachings about being slow to anger, being peacemakers, and being long-suffering. It’s unlikely that any Christian would counter that argument. But we aren’t robots either. We were created with feelings.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks quite a bit about anger, but it doesn’t say that we shouldn’t feel it. Feeling angry is a natural human emotion. Even Christ Himself felt righteous anger at the moneychangers in the temple. He overturned their tables in His wrath. The Bible doesn’t condemn anger as an emotion, but gives us guidelines about how to handle it.</p>
<p>“In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.” (Ephesians 4:26-27, NIV). This means that we will feel anger, but it’s what we do with that anger that matters.</p>
<h3>How should Christians respond?</h3>
<p>If it’s inevitable, even condoned, that you will feel anger, how should you respond? The Bible tells us to be slow to speak and slow to anger (James 1:19, NIV). All of our reactive responses, like slammed doors and yelling, might not align with God’s Word. If we feel anger welling up inside, it is best to take control of that feeling, examine the true source of the anger, and then respond with godly action.</p>
<p>Godly action means turning your anger over to God. You use prayer and Scripture to guide you to a resolution. Is this a righteous anger, selfish, or sin-based? Ask yourself if you are being motivated by justice and a love for God, as Jesus was in the temple, or are you angry out of selfish motives? Whatever the motivation driving your anger, as a Christian, you need to be quick to forgive and speak your truth gently to avoid stirring up more anger. (Proverbs 15:1)</p>
<p>Being a Christian doesn’t make you a pushover; it gives you guidelines toward a righteous and godly resolution. That often comes in the form of a difficult conversation or establishing boundaries. You might have to tell someone how they’ve hurt you or insist on a set of rules to protect your peace.</p>
<h3>But what if you can’t talk it out?</h3>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-2.jpg"><img alt="anger " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-85925" height="300" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/when-anger-leaves-a-trail-steps-toward-confession-healing-and-empowerment-2.jpg" width="200" /></a>If you’re holding anger toward someone who has blocked you, ghosted you, moved, put a restraining order on you, or has died, you might wonder if the feelings inside of you will ever be satisfied. You might long to have a conversation with them, detailing how they mistreated you or explaining how you feel misunderstood.</p>
<p>But if they aren’t available to receive this information or to interact, you might be left with a tightly wound ball of anger and frustration. In counseling, there’s a technique called the empty chair technique. This technique allows an individual to identify and vocalize difficult emotions such as anger.</p>
<p>An individual speaks to an empty chair, visualizing that there is an individual actually occupying the chair. This technique provides a safe space for emotional expression, insight, and awareness. It can begin to allow greater space for healing and self-discovery.</p>
<p>While you might not be able to spill your heart or explain your feelings to a loved one who has passed away or justify your actions to an ex who has you blocked, you can still get that anger out in a productive way.</p>
<p>If you take the time to carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly pour your emotions out, your brain will have nearly the same benefit as it would if you were having the conversation with the person you’re angry with. This can bring the peace you are looking for. Here are some additional ways you can release the anger you hold inside.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong></p>
<p>Prayer is a wonderful way to get that anger out of your heart and head and into the hands of God. Sometimes people think of prayer simply as a laundry list of wants or a formality, but prayer really is a conversation. If you’re feeling angry about something, tell God. Tell God your side of the story, ask for His intervention and peace, and dive into Scripture for further direction. As you’re praying, begin to visualize how you want your life to look when you’re feeling less angry.</p>
<p>Releasing your pent-up thoughts and describing the injustices that have been dealt to you is healing. And what better audience than your loving Heavenly Father, who just so happens to hold the power of the universe in His hands.</p>

<title>How EMDR Treatment Works and Who Benefits Most From It</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, the popularity of EMDR treatment has increased significantly, yet many remain unsure of how it works. Simply put, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of guided psychotherapy that aims to help a person’s brain process trauma. It is an effective form of therapy grounded in science and evidence and is recognized by the World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association.</p>
<p>What makes EMDR treatment unlike talk therapy is the use of bilateral stimulation. In a session, the therapist will ask the patient to begin to talk about the events that have caused them distress. While they speak, they are instructed to focus on the therapist’s hand, an object, a sound, or a series of light taps, which alternate back and forth, from left to right.</p>
<p>As they speak, their eyes move back and forth following the therapist’s instructions. This motion prompts the brain’s natural healing process to take place. Being skeptical of such an unusual method is understandable, but learning the science of EMDR treatment is a good place to start.</p>
<h3>A Brief History Of EMDR</h3>
<p>EMDR treatment began with psychologist Francine Shapiro in 1987. Whilst out for a walk in the park one day, she began to realize that as her eyes moved rapidly from one point of stimulation to another, the intensity of her emotions and thoughts was calmed. This experience led her to conduct therapy-based experiments on herself and a control group, leading to surprisingly positive results.</p>
<p>By 1991, she had developed a detailed prototype of EMDR treatment, which she began teaching to licensed therapists and clinicians. There have since been over thirty controlled outcome studies of EMDR treatment, each showing the effectiveness of the cognitive-based therapy.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to know the history of a popular form of therapy, and it’s still natural to have questions. More than any other form of psychotherapy, EMDR treatment is possibly the most confusing to hear about and understand from an outside perspective. Let’s break it down to the core essentials of how EMDR works.</p>
<h3>It starts with memories</h3>
<p>Everything we experience, both good and bad, helpful and harmful, is stored in our brain as a memory. These memories are like files on a computer that can be opened, viewed, and closed again, without any issues. They sometimes show that trauma occurred, and serve as a reminder of the experience, but just like scars that remain after an injury, they do not continue to cause pain or distress. Memories like this are known as adaptive memories.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it.jpg"><img alt="emdr treatment " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-48819" height="169" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it.jpg" width="300" /></a>For example, you might have an unexpectedly heated interaction with a stranger online that results in them calling you names and making threats to your safety. Though you don’t know this person and will likely report and block them, you are understandably upset and distressed by this experience.</p>
<p>Although you move on with life, that experience often pops up in the back of your mind or even in your dreams at night and affects your day-to-day well-being. You’re not being oversensitive or overreacting about this situation, despite how you might try to trivialize the experience.</p>
<p>In time, however, you realize that you’re safe and that none of the things this stranger said to you have stuck. A friend might have encouraged you and reminded you of all the times you were a decent person. You can rationalize that this person doesn’t know you, and that whatever statements they made came from a place of ignorance and were idle threats.</p>
<p>Eventually, the emotions from this experience begin to subside and vanish. Ultimately, the experience was like tripping and scraping your knee. It was painful at the time, but it caused no lasting damage.</p>
<h3><strong>Maladaptive Memories</strong></h3>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes we experience something that takes ages to heal, affecting us for years and even decades after it happened. These memories are like complex, infected injuries that will only heal when a doctor inspects them and prescribes treatment. This is where EMDR comes in.</p>
<p>When we experience something traumatic, our bodies take a kind of screenshot of what happened. These screenshots contain information that our nervous system consults to avoid similar future experiences. It remembers details, including sounds, smells, the time of day, the location of the event, the body language of the people involved, their tone of voice, facial expressions, and the emotions and physical sensations you felt at the time.</p>
<p>These trauma screenshots are known as maladaptive memories. Maladaptive memories are like excessively large files on a computer system, taking up space and requiring a lot of energy to process. Our brains tend to keep these maladaptive memories open and running in the background, as they constantly scan for information related to the trauma screenshot.</p>
<p>This is a neurological function that is designed to keep us from danger. But it backfires. With a maladaptive memory constantly awake and scanning for danger, the trauma will never heal sufficiently for us to move on.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it-2.jpg"><img alt="emdr treatment " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-85900" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/how-emdr-treatment-works-and-who-benefits-most-from-it-2.jpg" width="300" /></a>To continue with the computer analogy, a maladaptive memory is hard to shut down because, unlike an adaptive memory, you can’t find where the maladaptive memory is stored. Despite how prominent it feels and how regularly it interferes with all your other mental and emotional processes, it is like a program that exists without a path or filename to follow and locate.</p>
<p>In the example of arguing with a stranger online, you were able to connect that experience to real-life experiences and test the validity of that person’s statements and threats. EMDR treatment allows you to convert the maladaptive memory and store it in your brain as an adaptive memory.</p>
<h3>How EMDR Treatment Works</h3>
<p>Maladaptive memories affect the part of your brain known as the amygdala. Most of your emotions, trauma responses, and survival instincts come from this part of your brain. Ordinarily, the amygdala is connected to the part of your brain responsible for logic, understanding, and reason, known as the prefrontal cortex. Together, the logical and emotional parts of your brain work together to help you process trauma.</p>
<p>However, maladaptive memories often cause the neural pathways in your brain to break down. This means that the emotions connected to that past experience always feel real and present because they are not connected to the logical part of your brain. When your eyes follow the back-and-forth movements in EMDR treatment, something happens in your brain. The eye movements help open the neural pathways in your brain, allowing emotions and reason to communicate with each other again.</p>
<p>This ultimately calms your nervous system and brings you out of survival mode, as your nervous system begins to understand that the threat is in the past, and that you are not in any present danger.</p>
<p>In the 1990 film <em>Home Alone</em>, young Kevin McCallister is accidentally abandoned by his family and has to brave the holidays on his own. One of the tasks he must face is doing laundry. The washing machine is located in the basement next to a scary-looking furnace.</p>
<p>To him, the furnace looks like a hungry monster waiting to devour him. It is only after facing some genuine threats and having some positive experiences that he can go into the basement and tell the furnace monster to “shut up.” His brain is finally able to distinguish real threats from imagined ones.</p>
<p>This is a picture of what EMDR does for people and who benefits most from it. Our monsters might be unveiled to be nothing other than shadows on the wall, or echoes from the past. You are not weak for experiencing continued trauma from a past event, and you are not beyond help either.</p>

<title>9 Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s not always easy to know when you are in an emotionally abusive relationship, even when there is regular conflict. Confrontations and fights are not always a bad thing, because sometimes it’s better to express yourself and deal with the consequences of being a little too honest. However, some people are consistently defensive, manipulative, and skilled at avoiding accountability while making you feel at fault.</p>
<p>If someone defaults to being toxic or emotionally abusive, whether in their daily communication or the way they handle confrontations, it can be hard to call things out. When you can see the signs of emotional abuse in a relationship, you can begin to hold them accountable for this behavior and avoid constantly feeling like the guilty party.</p>
<h3>Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship</h3>
<p>Not everyone who causes conflict or has big emotions in a relationship is emotionally abusive. However, this is exactly how so many truly toxic people get away with using emotionally abusive tactics in a relationship. They tend to know exactly what to say, how to say it, and when to shift focus to avoid being held accountable for having to apologize.</p>
<p><img alt="9 Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship" class="alignleft wp-image-44146" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-signs-of-emotional-abuse-in-a-relationship-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Though you might not realize that your partner is emotionally abusive, you will eventually begin to feel unwell from being made into the antagonist of the narrative they have constructed. It’s also good to know the signs of emotional abuse in a relationship because these are tactics that you could end up falling for and using yourself, if only to escape carrying the unfair share of the blame.</p>
<p>In the context of an intimate relationship, whether romantic or not, some toxicity will inevitably spill out from time to time. Everyone has some degree of darkness and hurt in them, and at some point, it will come to the surface. When we talk about signs of emotional abuse in a relationship, we are talking about consistent patterns of behavior, not occasional tendencies. Here are some of the most common signs of emotional abuse in a relationship:</p>
<p><strong>Constantly playing the victim</strong> Some people have never learned that they are allowed to make mistakes and that they can make amends when they do. They are so used to playing the victim that they do it subconsciously, even when they are the perpetrators of injustice or emotional abuse. They frame every situation as one that gave them no choice in how to act, and they are often incredibly convincing.</p>
<p>Many people who play the victim are convinced that they are the victim and will resist accepting another point of view. One of the ways to know if your partner constantly plays the victim is to ask yourself how often you feel like the bad guy, because there can’t be two victims in regular conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Never apologizing</strong> Along with constantly playing the victim, emotionally abusive people will never apologize because they are convinced that they have nothing to apologize for. There are different ways of apologizing, whether it is acknowledging your hurt and their part in it, or making efforts to right their wrongs.</p>
<p>Emotionally abusive people will do none of these things but will expect you to do these things for them. When you are with an emotionally abusive partner, you will often feel like their parent, teacher, therapist, or even their boss because of how little responsibility they take for things.</p>
<p><strong>Shifting the focus to avoid accountability</strong> Related to these abusive tactics, one of the clear signs of emotional abuse is when people try to cause diversions or distractions in the middle of a confrontation. They do this so that they can avoid being held responsible for harm or taking accountability for any of their actions.</p>
<p>As soon as the topic starts hitting a little too close to home, they will pivot the conversation, shift focus from themselves, or act out in a distracting way to throw you off kilter. When they start gaslighting you as a part of these escape tactics, you might genuinely begin to feel like you have misunderstood the situation and might eventually let them off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>Making excuses or long-winded explanations to avoid apologizing</strong> You can often discern a dishonest person by the level of detail their explanations have. Truly innocent people tend not to remember precise details of events, whereas people who have had time to rehearse their excuses will add unnecessary details.</p>
<p>One of the ways that emotionally abusive people avoid being caught in their wrongdoing is to provide elaborate and articulate excuses and explanations to explain their supposedly innocent behavior. It’s best to stop them in their tracks and call them on this tactic before they get a chance to share more of their stories.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="9 Signs of Emotional Abuse in a Relationship 1" class="alignright wp-image-44147" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9-signs-of-emotional-abuse-in-a-relationship-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Minimizing or dismissing what you say</strong> If there is one tactic emotionally abusive people love to use during an argument, it’s minimizing or dismissing your point of view. They might call you over-emotional, hypersensitive, or worse. The sad part is that this tactic is often effective. You are often left feeling hurt and angered by whatever they did to cause the argument in the first place, and stung by their dismissal of your reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Telling you how you should feel</strong> Statements like, “You have no right to be upset about this,” or “You really need to get over this,” are emotionally abusive things to say, regardless of context. Even during the times when you might overreact, your feelings were not fake or disingenuous.</p>
<p>A mature partner would observe and react to your emotions, weighing your responses. If your responses were disproportionate, they would help you see it. Trying to tell you how you should feel is a sign of emotional abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawing and being silent when they are angry</strong> Some people go silent and withdraw when they are angry because they are trying to regulate their emotions. They take time and space to process their thoughts and feelings, and to resolve the issue when they are in a calmer and clearer state of mind. This is healthy and mature, but it is not the same reason emotionally abusive people withdraw when they are angry.</p>
<p>Emotionally abusive people use distance and silence as a way to control the situation and manipulate you into making the first move of reconciliation on their terms. They are not trying to regulate their emotions, but are stewing in their anger until it turns bitter.</p>
<p><strong>Accusing you of doing things that they are guilty of doing</strong> It often happens in cases of cheating and infidelity where the guilty party accuses the other of the very thing they are doing. Emotionally abusive people are often aware of what they are doing wrong and will try to skew the narrative by projecting their guilt onto you.</p>
<p>As absurd as their accusations can be, it is still hurtful to be accused of things that you have never done. All because they are trying to avoid being found out and having to come clean.</p>
<p><strong>Making everything a personal attack when they are angry</strong> In any relationship, there will be times when emotions run high, and things get heated. During these times, it’s not uncommon for people to say things that they will later regret, even if those things were true.</p>
<p>Emotionally abusive people, however, have a habit of cutting right to the core in blunt, harmful ways every time you fight. They do this to catch you off guard and gain an upper hand in the argument, and it is a toxic and emotionally abusive tactic.</p>
<h3>Getting Free from Emotional Abuse</h3>
<p>It can take time to recognize the signs of emotional abuse, and even longer to figure out what to do next. If your partner is open to taking their share of responsibility and healing, there are options like couples counseling and individual therapy that could help the relationship. However, many emotionally abusive people have no interest in working to fix things, and you might have to start focusing on doing what is best for you to move on.</p>
<p>A big part of healing is in focusing on yourself and discovering what it is you need most in life. It helps to talk things through with someone who has experience and insight into relationships and people, like a counselor. If you would like to find a counselor to talk to, please contact us.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>There is something about the dawn of a new year. Maybe it’s embracing a fresh start, righting the wrongs, or doing the things we didn’t have time to do over the last twelve months. For some people, starting a new “year” happens every 90 days as they focus on their goals.</p>
<p>Often, people resolve to lose weight or fix body image issues each year. Many of those people set the same goal year after year. Sometimes, this is due to unrealistic goals and expectations. When we don’t meet our goals, we feel worse, and negative body image issues creep up, interfering with our relationships and social lives.</p>
<h3>How to Overcome Body Image Issues</h3>
<p>Body image is how we think, perceive, and feel about our bodies. It is our behavior regarding our body appearance, shape, size, and weight. Poor body image can lead to body image issues. How often have you perused a magazine and compared your body to the model&#8217;s or actor’s body? Do you obsess over the latest celebrity diet because you want to look like them? Do you make disparaging remarks about your own body or appearance, even in jest?</p>
<img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year 1" class="alignleft wp-image-57215" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />With the invention of social media, more people are having trouble with body image issues. We follow influencers, scroll through an old classmate’s pictures, and post about our own struggles with weight, size, or appearance. Your body image issues may be ingrained in you from childhood, or you may have developed them recently after a weight gain, pregnancy, stressful event, menopause, or the aging process.</p>
<p>It is possible to learn to accept your body where it is and love it while you pursue health. The following are several tips for overcoming body image issues.</p>
<p><strong>Remember you are made in His image and likeness</strong>
<blockquote><p><em>Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” so God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</em> – <strong>Genesis 1:26-27, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the book of Genesis, we learn that God created us in His image and likeness. God, one of the Trinity, chose to make human beings mirror Him. We often forget that when we look in the mirror.</p>
<p>We are a reflection of God, but we only see our human frailties and what we consider flaws. The next time you look in the mirror, reflect on God’s words. Know that God created you just as you are and wants you to care for your body by not abusing, neglecting, or disparaging it.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year 2" class="alignright wp-image-57216" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-3-334x500.jpg" width="200" />Comparison is a thief</strong></p>
<p>“Comparison is the thief of joy.” Most of us are familiar with this quote from Theodore Roosevelt, yet we compare our bodies and lives with those of others anyway. Comparison is a tough habit to break. We compare our possessions, finances, marriages, children, homes, careers, and bodies to others.</p>
<p>We use this comparison as a scale to measure our success. We know that each individual has their own problems and hidden issues that they never show the world, but we compare and beat ourselves up for not measuring up.</p>
<p>When it comes to body image issues, we need to be less judgmental about other people’s appearances. Note your thoughts when you see someone else. Do you judge them by appearance, beauty, shape, size, or weight? This only feeds your own insecurities. Instead, note the good things about someone. This subtle mindset shift will spill over into how you view yourself. Instead of pointing out your flaws, you may appreciate what you like best about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Limit social and print media</strong></p>
<p>Comparison is a problem. It is easy to do with social, digital, and print media. We see our favorite actors and celebrities on television and in magazines looking svelte and thin, and we want desperately to have that type of “success.” We forget that these images are highly edited and filtered.</p>
<p>Limit your exposure to media that makes you feel not good enough. For example, instead of mindlessly scrolling social media during a break, quickly check your notifications and find something else to do. Cutting back on screen time helps your mental health and relieves eye strain.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year" class="alignleft wp-image-57214" height="200" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Learn to accept compliments</strong></p>
<p>If you hide behind self-deprecating humor when someone pays you a compliment, you are only hurting yourself and further tearing down your own body image. Ask yourself why you cannot accept the compliment. Is it because you don’t believe the other person really means it? Do you think you are not worthy of people appreciating you? Do you feel like a fake, and if they only knew the “real” you, they wouldn’t say that?</p>
<p>These thoughts and beliefs go much deeper and probably fuel your poor body image issues. They may stem from childhood abuse, trauma, or neglect. You may have been abused or betrayed by someone you loved and now cannot see past the hurt. You are worthy of love, respect, and honor. You might not feel like that’s true right now, but it is. Learn to accept the compliments with a thank you. Seek counseling if you need help with self-esteem, confidence, and self-worth.</p>
<p><strong>Lean toward health, not “diet” culture</strong></p>
<p>Poor body image can cause us to jump into diet culture and try trendy new diets for quick results. But these “quick fixes” only cause us to focus more on the body. Instead of focusing on losing weight, wearing a specific size, or toning up a body part, lean toward getting healthy.</p>
<p>When health becomes our number one focus, everything else will eventually fall into line. Set health goals, not weight or size goals. Instead of overwhelming yourself with New Year’s resolutions, set goals to promote your health today.</p>
<p>For example, instead of stating a goal of never eating sugar again this year (only to slip and eat a piece of candy on day three), focus only on today. For today, you will plan your meals without sugar. Then, focus on one meal at a time. Focus on your health in small time periods as these days will compound.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on performance, not ideals</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Overcoming Body Image Issues in the New Year 3" class="alignright wp-image-57217" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/overcoming-body-image-issues-in-the-new-year-4-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Those hefty New Year’s resolutions of joining the gym, working out every day, or losing fifty pounds in in twelve months, can be unrealistic which only leads to giving up. Most of us set large and unrealistic goals and then felt bad when we didn’t follow through. This may have fed a belief that you never finish anything. You can finish. We all can, but only by focusing on consistent performance instead of the ideals we have in our heads.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the results, which can worsen body image issues if you don’t reach them quickly enough by your standards, focus on performance. Use a calendar to mark if you did specific tasks to reach your destination that day.</p>
<p>For example, if working out will help you achieve your goals, focus on giving yourself a fun sticker on the wall calendar for each day you work out. You could use different stickers for various activities. The streak in activity will grow, and eventually, you will see results without feeling overwhelmed. Concentrate on those consistent activities.</p>
<h3>Seek help with body image issues</h3>
<p>If body image issues cause turmoil in your relationships, social life, and daily activities, or if you have developed anxiety and depression over your appearance, body shape, size, or weight, consider having some sessions with a therapist.</p>
<p>People face body dissatisfaction for various reasons, but you can overcome body image issues as you continue to get physically and mentally healthy. If you are ready for that journey, contact our office today to schedule an appointment with a counselor. Make this New Year the best yet.</p>

<title>Common Misconceptions About DBT for Teens</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Latoya’s relationship with food had always been complicated, and though she had heard of DBT for teens working for some of her peers, she had no idea how it could help her. Latoya’s eating disorder developed gradually over several years. Her journey toward needing DBT for teens was a complex interplay of psychological, emotional, and social factors.</p>
<p>These were the stages in the development of Latoya’s teen eating disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Early Onset</strong> Latoya started struggling with food issues like comfort eating as early as she could remember, but by the age of fourteen, her challenges developed into a dangerous disorder. By this age, she started transitioning into bulimia, which is characterized by cycles of binge eating followed by purging.</p>
<p><strong>Body Image Issues</strong> Throughout her teenage years, Latoya’s body image issues became more intense, and she became increasingly dissatisfied with her appearance, with a constant obsession to control her weight.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Triggers</strong> Latoya’s eating disorder was rooted in emotional distress from financial problems at home that started when her dad was laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic, and she used food as a way to cope with her emotions, which led to unhealthy eating patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Early Intervention</strong> Latoya did not receive effective help early on due to several factors we will address later on, and this lack of intervention allowed her eating disorder to worsen over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens.jpg"><img alt="dbt for teens" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-62006" height="300" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens.jpg" width="200" /></a><strong>Transition to Disorder</strong> By the time she reached her sophomore year of high school, Latoya’s eating disorder had transformed into anorexia. She became increasingly obsessed with staying a specific weight to be happy with herself.</p>
<p>Eventually, the eating disorder led to severe health issues for her. Her days were consumed by thoughts of food and her body image. She avoided eating as much as possible and constantly weighed herself, driven by the belief that reaching a certain weight would make her happy.</p>
<p>It was only when Latoya started showing alarming signs of weight loss that her family and friends became deeply concerned and decided that she needed to get help. She was registered in a treatment program where she was introduced to dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which focused on teaching her skills to manage her emotions and develop a healthier relationship with food.</p>
<h3>Understanding DBT for Teenagers</h3>
<p>DBT is a specialized form of therapy designed to help adolescents manage intense emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms. It combines cognitive-behavioral techniques with concepts of mindfulness and acceptance.</p>
<p>This behavioral therapy model was developed in the 1980s by American psychologist Dr. Marsha Linehan, who realized that the traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone might not be effective enough for young patients with chronic self-destructive behaviors.</p>
<p>DBT for teens can be particularly effective for those dealing with issues like anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicidal ideation, or even borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>The idea is to practically equip them with the tools to navigate the challenges of adolescence more effectively.</p>
<h3>Key Components of DBT for Teens</h3>
<p>This therapy form has a philosophical basis on the dialectical process of balancing acceptance and change, which is what its name alludes to. It is also being adapted to treat various conditions, including mood disorders, substance use, and PTSD.</p>
<p>Here are its key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual therapy is meant to focus on problem-solving and addressing specific issues or maladaptive behaviors.</li>
<li>Skills training to teach teens practical skills in areas such as mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.</li>
<li>Providing real-time support to help teens apply DBT skills in their daily lives through phone coaching.</li>
<li>Involving the family in therapy sessions and skills training to support the teen’s progress.</li>
<li>Teaching that balances acceptance and change through unique models tailored for teens, such as “Walking the Middle Path.”</li>
<li>DBT for young people integrates standard CBT techniques with concepts of mindfulness, acceptance, and distress tolerance, drawing from contemplative meditation practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Latoya’s treatment might have started earlier in her life, but her treatment only started after her situation had escalated because no one thought her family problems would affect a child in the way they did.</p>
<p>In her community, among some of the wealthiest people in her state, financial struggles were not as easy to talk about or recognize. She didn’t seem to have the same kind of problem as other peers who received DBT for teens therapy early on.</p>
<p>This lack of intervention is often deeply entrenched in communities and driven by several myths that can lead to misunderstandings about its purpose and effectiveness, which can be held even by people who know about this kind of therapy.</p>
<h3>Common Misconceptions About DBT for Teens</h3>
<p><strong>Only teens with severe issues need DBT</strong> </p>
<p>Many people believe it is a highly complex therapy designed only for extreme behaviors or severe mental health issues, yet it can also benefit teens dealing with everyday issues like heartbreak, pubescent stress, and bullying. It teaches valuable skills for managing emotions and improving relationships.</p>
<p><strong>It is only another form of talk therapy</strong> </p>
<p>DBT is not like traditional talk therapy but is structured and skills-based, focusing on teaching practical techniques for emotional regulation, mindfulness, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens-2.jpg"><img alt="dbt for teens " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-81645" height="191" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/common-misconceptions-about-dbt-for-teens-2.jpg" width="300" /></a><strong>DBT concepts and skills are too complex for teenagers</strong> </p>
<p>People think it is too complicated for young minds to understand and use, yet it is tailored to be accessible for teens, with modules and exercises customized for their developmental level. Therapists use age-appropriate lingo, activities, and examples to make the skills relatable.</p>
<p><strong>Teens are required to commit to DBT for the long term</strong> </p>
<p>Some believe that the teen will require years of therapy to see any benefits, but while long-term commitment can enhance outcomes, many start to experience significant improvements in a relatively short period, usually within a few months.</p>
<p><strong>DBT is just for the individual teen</strong> </p>
<p>The therapy is designed to not only focus on the teenager while excluding their immediate family, but their involvement is one of the most integral parts of DBT for teens. Family members or caregivers are often involved in sessions and skills training to support the teen’s progress and improve family dynamics.</p>
<p>DBT therapy is a process that provides tools and skills that require practice and commitment while helping teens build resilience and healthier coping mechanisms over time. Understanding these misconceptions can help set realistic expectations and highlight the true benefits.</p>
<p>During her treatment, Letoya practiced being present in the moment, which helped her become more aware of her thoughts and feelings without judgment. She learned techniques to cope with difficult emotions and situations without resorting to harmful behaviors.</p>
<p>DBT trained Letoya to improve her communication skills, which helped her build stronger, more supportive relationships with her family and friends. Most importantly, gradually she discovered ways to regulate, understand, and manage her intense emotions, reducing the urge to control her life through food.</p>
<p>Through consistent practice of these skills, she has already started looking and feeling healthier and happier. She is still working on challenging her negative thoughts about food and her body, replacing them with more positive and realistic ones.</p>
<p>Now that she has been discharged from the treatment center after several months of intensive therapy, Letoya wants to use the DBT skills she has learned and remains committed to her recovery.</p>
<h3>Next Steps: Christian Counseling for Teens</h3>
<p>Every teenager has their own unique struggles, especially during this tricky phase of life. However, sometimes a teen can need extra help if they have fallen into unhealthy patterns and behaviors that harm their bodies or mental well-being.</p>
<p>Finding a therapist who specializes in dialectical behavior therapy for teens is a crucial step in supporting your teen’s mental health that you should take seriously. Contact us today for more information.</p>

<title>10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace</title>
<link>https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/articles/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/?p=57200</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:54:19 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Codependency in the workplace doesn’t typically start with bad intentions. It usually begins with a desire to be helpful, reliable, or liked. Then, when one person starts relying too much on another for emotional support, validation, or even task completion, the balance tips. Over time, that helpfulness becomes too much.</p>
<p>In these situations, one person starts carrying more than their fair share, while the other becomes too comfortable leaning on them. This can happen between coworkers, between managers and their teams, or even between a person and their job. The helper feels needed. The other person feels taken care of. But eventually, both people lose out. The helper feels drained, and the other person doesn’t grow or take responsibility.</p>
<p>Recovering from codependency means learning to be valuable to each other without losing yourself for both parties.</p>
<h3>Professionals Who Struggle the Most with Work Codependency</h3>
<p>People who work in roles focused on helping others are especially at risk for workplace codependency. This includes teachers, therapists, healthcare workers, nonprofit staff, social workers, and people who work closely with clients.</p>
<img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace 2" class="alignleft wp-image-57203" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-3-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Many such professionals tie their value to how much they give. The more they sacrifice, the more valuable they feel. Such a mindset can wear you down and lead to burnout. Once your sense of purpose depends on being useful, you may ignore your own needs, skip breaks, and stay quiet when your boundaries are crossed.</p>
<p>Even people who are great at their jobs can fall into this. High-performing professionals can fall into this trap, especially if they were raised to believe that helping others is the highest form of success. Often, it starts early in life, being taught that helping others is the most important thing you can do without any regard for your own well-being.</p>
<p>Codependency at work doesn’t always involve another person. Sometimes, it’s not a coworker or manager, it’s the job itself.</p>
<h3>How to Tell If You’re in a Codependent Relationship with Your Job</h3>
<p>Look through the following list and see if you can relate to any of these feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li>You feel guilty for taking time off, even if you’re sick or exhausted</li>
<li>You always agree to take on tasks that aren’t yours because you want to avoid conflict</li>
<li>You worry that setting boundaries will make people think you’re selfish</li>
<li>You feel uneasy or restless when you’re not working</li>
<li>You believe your only value depends on how much you do for other people</li>
<li>You stay in a draining job because you don’t want to disappoint anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>These habits usually come from learning, over time, that being helpful keeps you safe or respected. Recovering from codependency means learning to be supportive without losing yourself in the process.</p>
<h3>Being reliable is not the same as being available 24/7</h3>
<p><img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace 3" class="alignright wp-image-57204" height="225" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-4-500x375.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Many people confuse being reliable with being available all the time. But saying yes to everything, always answering messages, and being the one who fixes every problem doesn’t make you reliable; it makes it easy for others to stop respecting your time.</p>
<p>Real reliability means doing what you’ve committed to. It means being clear about your limits and sticking to them. Over-availability leads to confusion. Others may stop considering your time and assume you’ll always adjust to theirs.</p>
<p>Recovering from codependency happens once you start to learn how to be dependable without burning yourself out.</p>
<h3>How Recovery Boosts the Careers of Both the Enabler and Taker</h3>
<p>When someone who tends to over-give in any setting starts to recover, things begin to change. They stop trying to keep everyone happy and start focusing on what really matters. They delegate, speak up, and make choices based on their values instead of guilt. As a result, they feel more confident, and others start treating them with more respect.</p>
<p>Even at work, people who’ve been leaning too much on others also benefit when recovery begins. They start to take more responsibility for their own work and emotions. They learn to handle challenges instead of relying on someone to fix things for them. They grow stronger and become better teammates.</p>
<p>Getting out of the codependency cycle leads to better communication, healthier working relationships, and more balanced teams. It also helps people spot the same patterns in their personal lives.</p>
<h3>10 Steps That Help You Break Free</h3>
<p><strong>Keep track of your yeses</strong> Write down every time you agree to something you didn’t want to do. Review the list each week. You’ll start to notice when and where your boundaries are being ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Use the phrase “Let me get back to you” more</strong> This gives you space to think instead of saying yes right away. It helps you respond with intention rather than guilt or habit.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace" class="alignleft wp-image-57201" height="169" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-500x281.jpg" width="300" />Set working hours, even if you’re remote</strong> Define exactly when you’re available and when you’re not, and let people know. More importantly, stick to it. This helps both you and others respect your time.</p>
<p><strong>Stop saying sorry for having limits</strong> Instead of apologizing when you can’t do something. Replace “Sorry, I can’t” with “Thanks for understanding.” You’re not doing anything wrong by protecting your time and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Pay attention to who drains your energy</strong> Think about which people or situations leave you feeling guilty, anxious, or resentful. These are clues to where codependency may be hiding.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself an important question</strong> Would I still do this if no one noticed? If the answer is no, you may be doing it to please others rather than because it matters to you. You may be acting from a need for approval rather than genuine care.</p>
<p><strong>Start a “done for the day” ritual</strong> Whether it’s closing your laptop, taking a walk, or turning off notifications, mark the end of your workday. Do something that helps you mentally leave work behind.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t take on other people’s emotions</strong> You’re not in charge of how others feel about your boundaries or decisions. Let people have their own reactions without trying to fix them all the time. Emotions are a part of growth and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Get a boundary buddy</strong> Find someone you trust and talk about the goals you’re working on. Check in with each other regularly. Accountability helps you stay grounded.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrate progress</strong> Each time you say no, take a real break, or speak honestly about your needs, acknowledge it. Recovery is built on such small, consistent choices every day.</p>
<h3>When It Might Be Time to Talk to a Professional</h3>
<p>If you try working on all this but still find yourself right back to feeling anxious or guilty when you set a boundary, or if your job feels like your whole identity, it might be time to get some help. A trained therapist or coach can help you understand where these habits come from, how to change them, and how to build something healthier.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="10 Steps to Help with Recovering from Codependency in the Workplace 1" class="alignright wp-image-57202" height="225" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-steps-to-help-with-recovering-from-codependency-in-the-workplace-2-500x375.jpg" width="300" /></strong>You don’t need to hit a breaking point to ask for support. You just need a desire to feel more like yourself again. Recovering from codependency is possible, and you don’t have to figure it out alone.</p>
<p>If you’ve been reading this and recognize yourself as someone who gives too much, avoids conflict, or ties your worth to how useful you are (the enabler), it helps to admit that you want something different.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve been the one content with being spoon-fed and hand-held at work every step of the way (the taker), it’s okay to want something different that allows you to grow independently. Getting free from codependency in the workplace is a way for everyone to start caring for themselves.</p>
<p>If you’d like extra support, reach out to a trained counselor or life coach listed here. Use the contact information listed to schedule a call or appointment. You deserve to enjoy your work without losing yourself in it.</p>
<p>You also deserve support that helps you understand the roots of these patterns so you can build a healthier relationship with your work and with yourself.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a teenager reading this, perhaps the idea of counseling has come up in a conversation with your parents, a teacher, or maybe it’s just something that has crossed your mind. The idea of getting things off your chest might sound nice, right? So why the hesitation?</p>
<p>The thought of opening up to someone you don’t even know can feel a little awkward and unnerving. Or maybe you are worried about what others will think. Whatever your hesitation about counseling is, know that it’s okay to feel unsure, but it’s equally okay to take a cautious step forward anyway.</p>
<h3>Is something wrong?</h3>
<p>Just because you go to counseling doesn’t mean that something is wrong with you. In fact, many scholarly minds have argued that mental health counseling is good for everyone, not just those who feel like they need help.</p>
<p>Going to counseling is like going to the gym. Working out helps keep your body strong in the same way that counseling keeps your mind and emotions healthy. Just like a trainer in the gym will teach you how to be safe while exercising, a therapist can help you understand yourself better and equip you with tools to help you succeed in life.</p>
<h3>What Counseling Isn’t</h3>
<p>Therapy and counseling have been depicted in many ways in movies and on television over the years. It’s no wonder that many people have misconceptions about what real-life counseling is like.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens" class="alignleft wp-image-44134" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-500x333.jpg" width="300" />You have probably seen scenes of people lying on a sofa in an office, surrounded by images of Freud and shelves full of fancy psychological books. There’s a mental health professional in the room too, asking personal questions and nodding as someone pours out their deepest darkest thoughts. They say things like, “Hmm,” and “I see” occasionally, analyzing every word. This version of counseling looks intimidating!</p>
<p>Counseling in the real world is much different than how it is popularly represented. It isn’t a sinister tool to force you to spill your whole life to a stranger. It’s not some weird interrogation or a place where you are forced to divulge your most embarrassing moments and innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>When you go to counseling, you won’t be asked to cough up your darkest secret or compelled to dissect your every thought. You don’t have to lie on a couch or look at Rorschach ink blots. Real-life counseling is a lot less intimidating than most people think.</p>
<h3>What happens in a counseling session?</h3>
<p>If counseling isn’t like it’s portrayed in many pop cultural representations, what is a real counseling session like? The truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to counseling. Every counselor has a different style and a different personality, just as your story is unique to you. With that said, there are a few things you can expect at your sessions.</p>
<p>At first, you might spend time getting to know each other. The counselor will probably ask some basic questions to get the conversation started. This will give them an idea of where you’re coming from and what’s going on in your life. They might also ask you what you hope to get from going to counseling sessions.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens 3" class="alignright wp-image-44137" height="169" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-4-500x281.jpg" width="300" />The questions will be basic, especially at first. And even in those moments, you’re never required to talk. You’re in control of what you share and when you’re ready to share it.</p>
<p>The conversation doesn’t have to be one-sided. Ask questions and speak up if you’re uncomfortable. Advocating for yourself or asking clarifying questions not only puts you in charge of the conversation but can give your counselor helpful insights into how your mind thinks and how you process information.</p>
<h3>Why do parents want you to go?</h3>
<p>Your parents (or whoever takes care of you) might be encouraging counseling simply because they care. They want you to have someone safe to talk to, especially if life feels particularly confusing lately. Even when they want to help, sometimes parents just don’t have the right words or tools to communicate.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about how your parents will react to what you discover in counseling, it’s wise to share those concerns with your counselor. A good counselor can help you decide the best ways to communicate with your family.</p>
<h3>What if you don’t trust your counselor?</h3>
<p>Trust issues are real! These can be especially difficult obstacles when it comes to therapy. Unfortunately, counselors and therapists don’t have a magic wand they can wave to make you trust them right up front. Building trust with anyone is a process, so consider it normal if you feel hesitant to open up.</p>
<p>Even in your silence, counselors aren’t offended. Your caution isn’t something new to them, nor does it negate the purpose of going. They are trained to respect your feelings, to keep things confidential, and to create a safe environment for you to truly be yourself.</p>
<h3>What Counseling Can Do for You</h3>
<p>One of the best aspects of going to counseling is that it can help you know yourself better. You might think you are an expert on yourself, and in many ways, you are, but you will likely be surprised at how much you can learn. You might be carrying around emotional scars that you thought were healed. You may even be surprised at how certain thoughts and feelings shape how you see yourself and the world around you.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens 2" class="alignleft wp-image-44136" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-3-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Sometimes just talking to a counselor, a professional, unbiased third party, and sharing what’s on your heart and mind – in whatever way feels best to you – can lighten your burden and help you see things more clearly. A counselor or therapist’s role is not to tell you what to do, what to think, or how to feel, but rather to listen and guide you in discovering those things for yourself.</p>
<p>Therapy can also help you build skills. You’ll learn new ways to manage anxiety, cope with anger, improve communication, and build stronger, healthier relationships with family and friends. If you play sports, you know the benefits of having a coach.</p>
<p>A therapist is like a coach for your emotions and your thoughts, helping you learn how to understand and regulate your emotions and how to tame your difficult thoughts. They help you get stronger and more confident, even giving you a playbook for getting through life’s challenges.</p>
<h3>What will your friends think?</h3>
<p>There’s zero shame in seeing a therapist or counselor. More and more young people are turning to counseling these days. It’s actually become quite common. And just to ease your mind, counselors keep what you say confidential, which means that they won’t share your private conversations with others unless you give them permission or if you or someone around you is in danger of being harmed.</p>
<h3>The First Step</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s hard to remember that God cares deeply about every aspect of your life, and that includes your mental health. When you’re going through some of life’s heaviest moments, it’s good to lean on others to help get you through. God didn’t create you to be isolated and alone or to suffer silently.</p>
<p><img alt="Helpful Information About Counseling for Teens 1" class="alignright wp-image-44135" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helpful-information-about-counseling-for-teens-2-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Counseling can be one of the ways that God works in your life. He often uses people, like counselors, to help you through the rough spots.</p>
<p>Deciding to try counseling is an important first step toward taking control of your mental health. There’s an old saying that reads, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” (Lao Tzu) Deciding to seek counseling is a solid step forward.</p>
<h3>You’re worth it!</h3>
<p>The teen years can be fun, but also full of change, pressure, and lots of challenges. You might feel invisible or unimportant, and it might be easy to believe that your struggles don’t matter much in the larger picture. But you’re not invisible; you are important, and your feelings do matter.</p>
<p>You are loved. Even if it doesn’t feel that way sometimes. You’re loved by the people in your life, and you’re loved by God. Choosing to explore counseling is a brave step toward a healthier tomorrow. Fill out the contact form on the website or call to get started.</p>

<title>Coping Skills for Anger Patterns in Multiple Generations</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>English philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon pioneered the scientific methods of observation and experimentation that we still use today. He also wisely said, “A man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green.”</p>
<p>In other words, if you are intent on looking at others’ anger issues before looking at your own, you’ll just be perpetuating your need for healing. Before we consider coping skills for anger across generations, we first must examine how we handle our own emotions.</p>
<p>The reason you may be able to trace patterns of mismanaged emotions back to your father and his father (or mother and her mother) is that our home life, or as scientists refer to it, the “nurture” part of nurture vs. nature, has a profound impact on what we learn.</p>
<p>Even if we aren’t taught how to deal with our emotions, we’re taught how to deal with them.</p>
<p>Think about it: If your father never spoke words of value and love to you, you may tend to struggle sharing spoken words of value to those you’re most fond of, too. Or suppose you had a mother who left the house every time a conflict arose. In that case, you might also be tempted to leave the room or hide away with a book when you sense chaos, argumentativeness, or negative emotions like frustration and anger.</p>
<p>To develop helpful coping skills for addressing anger patterns across multiple generations, starting with your own self-reflection is key. Once you’ve recognized how you handle anger, you can look backward and forward – ideally helping future generations by setting a new paradigm of emotional health.</p>
<h3>Six Anger Patterns We May Recognize in Ourselves</h3>
<p><strong>The misguided belief that all anger is bad </strong>If you’ve grown up in a household with explosive anger or even abuse, you may shy away from any conflict or rising feelings of anger, believing all anger to be bad. But anger is designed to alert us. Almost like a roar alerts a lion’s prey to the forthcoming attack, anger alerts us to something that is outside the acceptable norm.</p>
<p>In the Bible, we see that Jesus was angry when a house of worship was turned into a place used for consumption and greed. (Matthew 21:12-17) Other reasons for anger might be that someone is hurt physically (such as stubbing a toe) or emotionally (which can easily stem from disappointment). Anger itself isn’t the issue; it’s often how we handle the anger that gets us into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>The anger pattern of ignorance</strong> Why would a person ignore how they feel? See number one. While you and I may agree that anger isn’t wrong in and of itself, some people may feel weak or afraid of their anger, so they push it down or ignore it.</p>
<p>If your friend or family member comes from an abusive home, they may fear their own response to anger. It’s easier to ignore how they feel rather than find a healthy way to cope with the feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Turning anger inward, particularly in introverts</strong> It’s not necessarily an unhealthy pattern if the introvert can turn that anger into something productive, such as emotional awareness, journaling, or recognizing a need to discuss it further with a mental health expert. But turning anger inward can be unhealthy if it leads you to suppress your anger, engage in self-harm practices, or suicidal ideation.</p>
<p>If any of these unhelpful and damaging practices sound familiar, please contact a licensed therapy practice. Our offices are here to help. If you feel you’re in danger of hurting yourself or others, please let someone know or go to your nearest emergency room.</p>
<p><strong>Abusive language</strong> Whether the language is abusive in tone, severity, or simply the word choice, humans of all ages deserve to be spoken to with respect. Hearing words that don’t reflect that level of respect is a problem.</p>
<p>It’s not a problem that can’t be overcome. Unfortunately, these communication patterns are learned, so one parent may teach them to their children without even realizing it. That child grows up, has his own children, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Much like cyclical poverty, communication poverty – speaking unkind or untrue words to each other – requires a variety of solutions, from various angles, to overcome. But with the right tools, support, and practice, you can learn new skills.</p>
<p><strong>Raising your voice quickly and easily</strong> If you find yourself yelling abruptly any time you’re in conflict or you sense an issue that’s different from your expectations, you may need some help with coping skills for anger. It’s easy to do, too, particularly if you’re in a stressful season like going through a divorce, job loss, or moving.</p>
<p>You might not necessarily have “inherited” this pattern from your parents or grandparents, but being quick to yell is a learned behavior that you’ll likely see in those around you if it isn’t unlearned. The good news is that coping techniques bring a welcome balm instead of raising your voice whenever you feel frustrated or plans don’t go as you expected them to.</p>
<p><strong>Physical expression is a go-to when you’re mad </strong>If your anger leads to punching a wall, hitting another person, or destroying something – even ripping up a piece of paper or smashing a glass &#8211; it can be telling.</p>
<p>Your physical expression of anger may be a mask for some deep-down patterns that may be overlooked when you’re not at the brink. Consider this: You’ve probably been frustrated, irritable, opinionated, or disappointed many times. What is it that leads to your anger rising to the level of physical outbursts?</p>
<p>It may be that the deeper issue is something a mental health counselor can help you uncover and, most importantly, gain healing from. If you’d like a compassionate coach to guide you through the reasons for your anger and learn coping skills for anger patterns at the same time, our offices are filled with qualified, licensed professionals. We’re happy to match you with the right person in your area.</p>
<h3>Three Coping Skills for Anger Patterns in Multiple Generations</h3>
<p>Are you looking for ways to cope with your anger as you’re seeking healing from the roots of it? Here are some actionable ideas you can start applying today that will impact not only your life but also the lives of generations to come.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Auto Draft 230" class="alignleft wp-image-57195" height="300" src="https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/auto-draft-243-381x500.jpg" width="229" />Avoid talking about irritations, disappointments, and frustrations with people who tend to stir up your anger</strong></p>
<p>We all have that friend or close family member – maybe even a co-worker you see every day – who tends to encourage us in our feelings, especially when they’re negative. They may not intend to, but their confirmation of our feelings goes beyond understanding. It usually veers into a lane that says, “I hear you, I agree, and I cannot believe they did that or said that. Here’s why I’d be mad, too.”</p>
<p>In times of frustration, we often want to vent. A recommendation is to choose a friend who is known for her quickness to listen and slowness to speak. The Bible reminds us to “be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger” (James 1:19 ESV).</p>
<p>There is a foundational reason that these three ideas are connected: a person who is quick to listen and slow to speak is usually wise, thoughtful, and carefully reviews information, processing it internally and weighing out their words before commenting. A person who is wise and withholds quick words is also often slow to anger. They don’t let circumstances cause them to lose their cool as easily as others.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a friend in your life like this, pull out your phone and record a voice memo to vent your frustrations. The act of talking about it is what we need in the moment, not necessarily the comments from others. Yes, validation is important, but if your go-to is a friend who stirs up strife, it’s not going to help you manage your anger.</p>
<p><strong>Find your fuel and deposit currency regularly</strong></p>
<p>Anger is often fueled by a lack of something else; it might be a lack of feeling understood, a lack of rest, not getting enough support from friends or family, or feeling unheard and undervalued at work. Essentially, what you need is healthy fuel. It is healthy to want encouragement, to need rest, to desire appreciation and feedback from others in various contexts. What’s not healthy is using anger to get it.</p>
<p>If you begin to recognize what you need most on a regular basis, you can ask for it. If you need more support at home, schedule a family meeting where you can ask family members to share regularly the good things they see you and each other doing. Share that you could use some extra help around the house, and ask for specific ways they can chip in. At the same time, let it be a forum for them to voice their needs as well.</p>
<p>If you need rest, make time every day to spend thirty minutes to an hour doing something that feels restful. Take a walk with your dog, read a book, or listen to music. Connecting our senses to our rest format is an avenue of rest we don’t often explore, but it’s much more restorative than we realize.</p>
<p>Think about what you listen to, look at, touch, and taste, and how you move your physical body. These all go into rest if you incorporate rhythms of silence, exercise, nature, or other life-giving activities.</p>
<p><strong>When you feel stressed, frustrated, or disappointed, develop a mental tagline or a physical response that you can integrate into a habit</strong></p>
<p>You might say to yourself, “I’m upset, but this will be okay” every time you notice frustration or disappointment, and that saves you from the angry outburst you might have had before. Another friend adds the words “for now” to the end of a sentence. She might say, “My life is so hard (for now).” It helps her remember that the challenges she faces aren’t going to last forever. These are mental taglines that can protect you from angry outbursts.</p>
<p>Or you might find a rock, a carved cross, or a soft piece of fabric – something you can carry with you anywhere – that’s accessible for you to hold. In times of frustration or irritation, reach out and hold the object to remind you there’s a place of peace accessible to you, and anger isn’t the only way to respond to the situation.</p>
<p>If you’d like more resources, we have counselors who can help you find additional coping skills for anger. Contact our offices today to learn more.</p>

<title>Finding Support for Depression in Aging Women</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The idea of eternal youth is a wildly popular narrative in fictional stories and legends. The legend of the Fountain of Youth, for example, was famously sought out by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. He risked his life looking for a magical spring whose waters could restore youth and vitality to all who would drink it. In <em>Tuck Everlasting</em>, the fountain of youth is such a coveted secret that it creates all types of chaos.</p>
<p>Why are stories like these popular? On some level, most people wish they could retain their youthful energy and good looks forever.</p>
<p>The beauty industry figured out a long time ago that people, particularly women in Western cultures, are willing to part with their hard-earned cash for younger-looking, firmer skin, a youthful glow, and a firmer body. Every year, billions of dollars are spent on creams, serums, supplements, and sculpting tools that promise tighter skin, firmer bodies, and that elusive glow.</p>
<p>When all those creams and potions fail to work, many women have to face the hard, uncomfortable truth that they are aging. That can cause a wide assortment of emotional upheaval, even to the point of depression.</p>
<h3>Is it society’s fault?</h3>
<p>In many ways, society bears much of the responsibility for how women view themselves as they age. The mass media, which both influence and reflect cultural values, often promote the idea that youth equals beauty, which can make it difficult to grow older without confidence and self-doubt. Research says that “as few as 12% of older women are satisfied with their body size.” (Cameron et al, 2019)</p>
<img alt="Finding Support for Depression in Aging Women 1" class="alignleft wp-image-44128" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-support-for-depression-in-aging-women-2-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Pick up a fashion magazine and flip through the pages. You’ll see models who have been airbrushed, strategically posed, and photoshopped. Each image is carefully curated and created. The models’ hair, makeup, and clothing are the product of a team of professionals who assure perfection with little regard to reality. The same goes for film, television, and social media messaging.</p>
<p>Western society seems to value beauty and youth above all, frequently neglecting deeper realities and spiritual well-being. At least that’s the message we get. How many overweight and elderly leading ladies can you think of?</p>
<p>Of course, some women have broken the mold and risen to prominence despite unrealistic standards, celebrating their natural, aging bodies. But even those women often face intense pressure to undergo plastic surgery, cosmetic procedures, and airbrushing.</p>
<p>There is such a heavy emphasis on flawlessness that anything outside of this narrow ideal is dismissed or overlooked. With all this emphasis on beauty and youth, it’s no wonder that when women age, they start to feel less valuable, less powerful, and less desirable.</p>
<h3>Is it the body’s fault?</h3>
<p>As a woman ages and menopause kicks in, the body changes. It’s inevitable. With hormone levels changing and metabolism slowing down, skin starts to sag and wrinkle, and body fat becomes increasingly difficult to combat. Aging happens to everyone. And no amount of cream or tonic can change it.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious changes in appearance, there is the body’s natural slowdown. Arthritis may form, or you might develop diabetes. Or maybe your aging body is slower and achier than it used to be. Whatever the case, losing your youthful look and then dealing with related health issues can make women feel hopeless.</p>
<p>Mental health also changes as a person ages. Life stages such as caregiving for elderly parents, dealing with the death of a spouse, watching grown children move out, and other issues that come up after age fifty, can bring on a variety of mental health issues that a woman may not have had to deal with earlier in her life. With the ups and downs of menopause and other health-related issues in the mix, it might be more difficult to deal with life than it was in younger years.</p>
<h3>Everything Changes</h3>
<p>A hard-to-hear truth is that society treats traditionally attractive women differently than it does other groups. Women who fit the mold of traditional beauty are often offered free drinks at the coffeehouse or allowed to cut in line at the amusement park. They may be able to sweet-talk a boss into forgiving them for a transgression with more success than another coworker. It’s all a part of the “pretty privilege” that many young women get to experience.</p>
<p>What happens when this privilege begins to fade? As age creeps in and traditional physical beauty fades, so does this privilege. This can feel like a rug is pulled right out from underneath you. You’re still the same person inside, but the world doesn’t respond to you the way that it used to. And if your identity has been even partially tied to how others perceive you, that loss can be devastating.</p>
<h3>God never changes</h3>
<p>Ready for some good news? Society changes, bodies change, and even your role can change, but the one thing that never changes is God.</p>
<p><img alt="Finding Support for Depression in Aging Women" class="alignright wp-image-44127" height="212" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-support-for-depression-in-aging-women-500x353.jpg" width="300" />While the world values outward appearances, God values your heart. He sees beyond wrinkles, stretch marks, and gray hairs. He sees your intention, perseverance, and the soul that He crafted, not only the shell it’s housed in.</p>
<p>Psalm 71 provides words to a prayer that many of us pray as we age. “Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.” (Psalm 71:9, NIV) God promises that He does not abandon us in our old age.</p>
<p>Aging may strip you of some superficial things, but it can also bring about clarity and great reward. As you experience life, you will begin to understand what really matters to you. You can stop chasing what the world values and says you should be and start becoming who God created you to be: a wise, faithful, gentle, bold, and kind woman of God.</p>
<h3>Therapy</h3>
<p>Like legends and stories you grew up hearing, the search for the Fountain of Youth reminds us that lasting youthfulness can’t be found in a magical spring or even an expensive tube of cosmetic cream. Aging is a natural, God-designed cycle of life and something that we should embrace with grace rather than fear.</p>
<p>Still, knowing this is one thing, but embracing aging is another. Depression in aging women is real. The emotional toll of physical changes, role redefinition, and cultural pressure can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Faith-based therapy can provide you with a place to process the grief you feel over your lost youth, identify changes in your body and mind, and help you unload the emotional weight of growing older. It can also provide a supportive environment to explore distorted thoughts or unresolved life experiences that have gone unaddressed.</p>
<p>God may not promise us smooth skin or boundless energy, but He does promise us gifts that are far more valuable and eternal. He offers you purpose, peace, and His companionship. And when you embrace that truth, you will start to shift your thinking about aging.</p>
<h3>The Fountain of Youth</h3>
<p>Your life goal shouldn’t be to stay young forever, but instead to grow older gracefully. Let your natural slowdown be a time to grow in your faith and God’s truth. And as you do, you will become more confident in who you are and in who He is.</p>
<p>The world might try to sell you some anti-aging serum and superficial ideals, but God invites you into something that is far more freeing. He is offering you the chance to live fully, not only in this season, but for eternity.</p>
<p>You might never find that legendary Fountain of Youth, but you can rest assured that you’re not invisible, no matter your age and no matter what the culture tells you. Your beauty is found in a heart inclined toward God.</p>
<p>You don’t have to face this season alone. Together, we can explore the feelings that come with aging and find hope and meaning. Call to learn more.</p>

Research says that “as few as 12% of older women are satisfied with their body size.” (Cameron et al, 2019)</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-support-for-depression-in-aging-women.jpg"><img alt="depression" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-85652" height="300" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-support-for-depression-in-aging-women.jpg" width="200" /></a>Pick up a fashion magazine and flip through the pages. You’ll see models who have been airbrushed, strategically posed, and photoshopped. Each image is carefully curated and created. The models’ hair, makeup, and clothing are the product of a team of professionals who assure perfection with little regard to reality. The same goes for film, television, and social media messaging.</p>
<p>Western society seems to value beauty and youth above all, frequently neglecting deeper realities and spiritual well-being. At least that’s the message we get. How many overweight and elderly leading ladies can you think of?</p>
<p>Of course, some women have broken the mold and risen to prominence despite unrealistic standards, celebrating their natural, aging bodies. But even those women often face intense pressure to undergo plastic surgery, cosmetic procedures, and airbrushing.</p>
<p>There is such a heavy emphasis on flawlessness that anything outside of this narrow ideal is dismissed or overlooked. With all this emphasis on beauty and youth, it’s no wonder that when women age, they start to feel less valuable, less powerful, and less desirable.</p>
<h3>Is it the body’s fault?</h3>
<p>As a woman ages and menopause kicks in, the body changes. It’s inevitable. With hormone levels changing and metabolism slowing down, skin starts to sag and wrinkle, and body fat becomes increasingly difficult to combat. Aging happens to everyone. And no amount of cream or tonic can change it.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious changes in appearance, there is the body’s natural slowdown. Arthritis may form, or you might develop diabetes. Or maybe your aging body is slower and achier than it used to be. Whatever the case, losing your youthful look and then dealing with related health issues can make women feel hopeless.</p>
<p>Mental health also changes as a person ages. Life stages such as caregiving for elderly parents, dealing with the death of a spouse, watching grown children move out, and other issues that come up after age fifty, can bring on a variety of mental health issues that a woman may not have had to deal with earlier in her life. With the ups and downs of menopause and other health-related issues in the mix, it might be more difficult to deal with life than it was in younger years.</p>
<h3>Everything Changes</h3>
<p>A hard-to-hear truth is that society treats traditionally attractive women differently than it does other groups. Women who fit the mold of traditional beauty are often offered free drinks at the coffeehouse or allowed to cut in line at the amusement park. They may be able to sweet-talk a boss into forgiving them for a transgression with more success than another coworker. It’s all a part of the “pretty privilege” that many young women get to experience.</p>
<p>What happens when this privilege begins to fade? As age creeps in and traditional physical beauty fades, so does this privilege. This can feel like a rug is pulled right out from underneath you. You’re still the same person inside, but the world doesn’t respond to you the way that it used to. And if your identity has been even partially tied to how others perceive you, that loss can be devastating.</p>
<h3>God never changes</h3>
<p>Ready for some good news? Society changes, bodies change, and even your role can change, but the one thing that never changes is God.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-support-for-depression-in-aging-women-2.jpg"><img alt="depression " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-85653" height="212" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finding-support-for-depression-in-aging-women-2.jpg" width="300" /></a>While the world values outward appearances, God values your heart. He sees beyond wrinkles, stretch marks, and gray hairs. He sees your intention, perseverance, and the soul that He crafted, not only the shell it’s housed in.</p>
<p>Psalm 71 provides words to a prayer that many of us pray as we age. “Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.” (Psalm 71:9, NIV) God promises that He does not abandon us in our old age.</p>
<p>Aging may strip you of some superficial things, but it can also bring about clarity and great reward. As you experience life, you will begin to understand what really matters to you. You can stop chasing what the world values and says you should be and start becoming who God created you to be: a wise, faithful, gentle, bold, and kind woman of God.</p>
<h3>Therapy</h3>
<p>Like legends and stories you grew up hearing, the search for the Fountain of Youth reminds us that lasting youthfulness can’t be found in a magical spring or even an expensive tube of cosmetic cream. Aging is a natural, God-designed cycle of life and something that we should embrace with grace rather than fear.</p>
<p>Still, knowing this is one thing, but embracing aging is another. Depression in aging women is real. The emotional toll of physical changes, role redefinition, and cultural pressure can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Faith-based therapy can provide you with a place to process the grief you feel over your lost youth, identify changes in your body and mind, and help you unload the emotional weight of growing older. It can also provide a supportive environment to explore distorted thoughts or unresolved life experiences that have gone unaddressed.</p>
<p>God may not promise us smooth skin or boundless energy, but He does promise us gifts that are far more valuable and eternal. He offers you purpose, peace, and His companionship. And when you embrace that truth, you will start to shift your thinking about aging.</p>
<h3>The Fountain of Youth</h3>
<p>Your life goal shouldn’t be to stay young forever, but instead to grow older gracefully. Let your natural slowdown be a time to grow in your faith and God’s truth. And as you do, you will become more confident in who you are and in who He is.</p>
<p>The world might try to sell you some anti-aging serum and superficial ideals, but God invites you into something that is far more freeing. He is offering you the chance to live fully, not only in this season, but for eternity.</p>
<p>You might never find that legendary Fountain of Youth, but you can rest assured that you’re not invisible, no matter your age and no matter what the culture tells you. Your beauty is found in a heart inclined toward God.</p>
<p>You don’t have to face this season alone. Together, we can explore the feelings that come with aging and find hope and meaning. Call to learn more.</p>

<title>Moving on From a Toxic Friendship</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Many people don’t consider toxic friendships traumatic, but they can be. Your toxic friendship doesn’t have to be fraught with physical abuse or criminal activity to take its toll on your emotions and leave scars on your heart.</p>
<p>If you’ve been through a toxic friendship, you know that it can be difficult to move on even in the aftermath of the relationship. It can be difficult to open your heart to another person, and it can be difficult to even know where to start to build a new, healthy friendship.</p>
<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>Healing from the traumatic relationship should be the first step in developing new, healthier ones. You don’t want to take the unforgiveness and other baggage from the past with you into your new relationships. To truly heal, you need to forgive, even if your former friend has never apologized or sought restitution or even taken responsibility for the things that damaged you.</p>
<p>The beauty of forgiveness is that it can be one-sided. You don’t have to wait for them to realize their fault or misstep for you to forgive them because forgiveness is as much for your benefit as it is for theirs. When you don’t forgive others’ trespasses, you’re denying the goodness of God, living in disobedience, and dwelling on the past.</p>
<p>Not sure how to forgive? It can be tricky to forgive others, especially when they show no signs of remorse. But that’s where God steps in. He can give you the love in your heart that spans the gap of their cavalier attitude.</p>
<h3>Seek forgiveness from God</h3>
<p>While forgiving the other person in your past relationship is an important part of the healing process, so is seeking forgiveness from God for your part in the failed friendship. Many people struggle with feelings of guilt or inadequacy after leaving a toxic relationship.</p>
<p>Whether you ignored the red flags, didn’t speak up for yourself, or even contributed to the toxic nature of the relationship, trying to punish yourself for your failings is inappropriate. It is God’s place to punish or forgive, and God’s forgiveness is wide enough to cover your regret, silence, and misplaced loyalty. So, while you’re offering forgiveness and grace to others, don’t forget to go to God and seek it for yourself.</p>
<h3>Letting People In</h3>
<p>Even though you may have forgiven your former friend, it doesn’t mean that you are automatically ready to let other people into your life. Just like any trauma, the emotional wounds may have healed, but sometimes scars remain.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/moving-on-from-a-toxic-friendship-scaled.jpg"><img alt="toxic friendship" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-36685" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/moving-on-from-a-toxic-friendship-scaled.jpg" width="300" /></a>You may worry that if you allow others into your life, they will end up being every bit as toxic as those you have removed. You may be cautious about opening up your heart and intimate thoughts to someone again, for fear that they will be misused.</p>
<p>You may have another difficult friendship in your life. People, every last one of us, are fallible, broken, and sinful. So, when we try to intertwine our lives with other people who are also fallible, broken, and sinful, it’s no wonder that conflict arises. But not all conflict is toxic, and you have to remember that imperfect people can have a positive impact on your life with the right boundaries in place and much grace.</p>
<p>Remember, you are not the same person you were when you were in that toxic relationship. You’ve grown. You know the warning signs of toxicity and the need for boundaries. You know that even though it was tough, you got through some pretty sticky situations.</p>
<p>And you know that God loves you. He loved you through the entire scary, frustrating, and humiliating breakup, and He loves you now, and He will love you right through any future struggles or obstacles. God can help you get over your issues of mistrust and your fear of intimacy so you can be open to letting people into your life.</p>
<h3>Be the kind of friend you want to attract</h3>
<p>So, how do you find new, healthy friends? That old saying, “To get a friend, you have to be a friend,” is true. If you want to have a healthy, loyal, and life-giving friendship, start becoming the kind of person you would want to have in your corner.</p>
<p>That means being honest with people, being dependable, and showing up for them when they need it. If you want a friend who will guard your reputation and listen without judgment, you have to model that behavior to others.</p>
<p>This isn’t the “law of attraction” where the energy you put out to the universe is what you’ll attract back. That principle is unbiblical and replaces faith in God with faith in self, putting the universe (rather than its Creator) in the position of authority and power. That being said, the concept of living out the characteristics you want to see in others is biblical.</p>
<p>Proverbs 13:20 says, “Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.” In other words, who you surround yourself with matters because it is who you become.</p>
<p>When you grow in wisdom, kindness, humility, and integrity, you will naturally draw people who value these same traits. When you start to “walk with the wise,” you will realize that you don’t have to settle for toxic patterns or surface-level connections that have made up some of your past relationships.</p>
<h3>Therapy</h3>
<p>If you have been through a toxic friendship and want to let people into your heart, but just don’t know how, consider seeking professional help through a Christian therapist. Sometimes the wounds from unhealthy relationships are complex and layered. Healing takes time, and seeing a Christian therapist can be beneficial.</p>
<p>A Christian counselor can offer a safe, confidential space for you to unpack your experiences, confront painful memories, and begin to heal. They’ll help you explore how past relationships may still be shaping your present and work with you to identify patterns of fear, mistrust, or insecurity that keep you from forming healing new connections.</p>
<h3>Trusting God with New Relationships</h3>
<p>When you’re ready to open your heart once again to a new relationship, know that you don’t have to go into the unknown blind and alone. Psalm 37:23 (NASB) says, “The steps of a man are established by the Lord, and He delights in his way.” If God can guide your career, your calling, and your personal growth, He can guide you in your relationships, too.</p>
<p>Pray for wisdom before connecting deeply with someone new. Ask the Holy Spirit to give you direction, and be intentional in developing your new relationship. Take time to get to know the new people in your life and pause before you jump into a deeply connected relationship.</p>
<p>Observing people from a distance, taking time to get to know them and their true character, and waiting for direction from the Holy Spirit can help you to choose the right types of people to invite into your life.</p>
<h3>You’re not alone in this</h3>
<p>While losing a friendship can feel like loneliness, you’re not alone. Even if your friend group sides with your ex-bestie or you no longer feel comfortable in your social circle, you are not alone. If you’re coming out of a toxic friendship, it’s natural to feel guarded, uncertain, or even afraid. But don’t believe the lie that this is where your story ends. Through loving therapy and with God’s help, you can heal and grow and love again.</p>

<title>Anxiety as a Teenager: Signs, Impact, and Treatment Options</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>My counseling journey began by working with teenagers, a population that often finds itself at the intersection of rapid growth, identity formation, and complex challenges. Supporting teens required me to cultivate patience, flexibility, and the ability to hold space for strong emotions while also encouraging hope and resilience.</p>
<p>Although at times it stretched me outside of my comfort zone, these early experiences shaped my foundation as a counselor and deepened my understanding of the importance of empathy, clear boundaries, and developmental awareness.</p>
<p>Life challenges come to us all, regardless of our background, faith, commitments, family situation, age, gender, or walk of life. We all face trouble, though that trouble comes in different forms for each of us. For teenagers, that stage of life comes with its own complications and specific challenges. It’s a time of significant change and transitions, of a lot of newness and growth. Change requires the ability to adapt.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges a teenager may face would include mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, eating disorders, or anger issues. A teen may struggle with body image issues, questions about gender and identity, wrestling with matters of faith, or difficult relationships with loved ones. These present challenges of various kinds, and they can affect the teen’s emotional, physical, mental, and social well-being.</p>
<p>Anxiety is a common enough concern among teenagers. According to CDC data from the last few years, around 11% of children aged 3 to 17 were diagnosed with anxiety, and specifically among adolescents (aged 12-17), around 20% reported having experienced symptoms of anxiety as recently as two weeks before the survey was conducted. Teen mental health is a significant concern that needs attention.</p>
<h3>Some Reasons for Anxiety as a Teenager</h3>
<p>The link between social media use and anxiety in teenagers has grown clearer in recent years, with evidence showing that excessive engagement can alter brain functioning, particularly through disruptions in dopamine regulation and reward processing, which may heighten vulnerability to anxiety.</p>
<p>Adolescents who spend significant time online often experience compulsive checking, comparison, and sleep disturbances, all of which are connected to increased emotional dysregulation and stress. Research highlights that more than half of existing studies report a positive association between social media use and anxiety, suggesting the risk is not only tied to the amount of time spent but also to the quality and patterns of use. (Hassani et al., 2024)</p>
<p>This anxiety response has its place in our lives, as it prepares our bodies for those moments when they need to act in our defense. The issue is that when the response is on a hair trigger, or when the physiological changes it brings linger past their usefulness or welcome, it can become a real problem. When anxiety is a constant companion and it derails normal daily functioning, it might be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder.</p>
<img alt="Anxiety as a Teenager: Signs, Impact, and Treatment Options 1" class="alignleft wp-image-43980" height="184" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anxiety-as-a-teenager-signs-impact-and-treatment-options2-500x306.jpg" width="300" />A teen may feel the regular type of anxiety that teens, or anyone else for that matter, can feel on a daily basis. For the most part, this normal anxiety and the feelings of stress that come with it disappear relatively quickly. After the moment passes, one’s heart rate drops and breathing evens out; the sense of dread passes, and the tight knot in their stomach disappears, in a few hours or perhaps in a day.</p>
<p>However, other, more intense forms of anxiety may affect a teen. That’s when the feelings of anxiety are quite intense, so much so that they get in the way of enjoying everyday life, or they disrupt the teen’s ability to play sports, learn in school, or engage in projects that matter to them. These feelings of anxiety, apart from being intense, might linger for days, weeks, months, or even longer, making it a serious concern.</p>
<p>A teenager might feel anxious due to social interactions with others, or they may feel anxious about their physiological development during puberty; being an early or a late bloomer can be cause for concern for a teen at a time when it feels important to fit in and develop their social life. A teen may also be anxious due to the various pressures placed on them by parents, teachers, coaches, or peers.</p>
<p>From the above, it’s evident that teens can have just as many reasons to feel anxious as older people, and the use of social media and excessive online engagement can affect them both the same way.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Anxiety</h3>
<p>The impact of anxiety varies from person to person. It affects your body and your mind. When you feel anxious, it can be physically uncomfortable. That discomfort can be a huge distraction at a moment when you’re trying to perform at your best. Anxiety can affect a teen’s ability to learn or perform at their peak.</p>
<p>If a teen feels anxious in social situations, those feelings of anxiety can form significant obstacles to forming friendships or bridging divides. Such anxiety can make it hard to raise concerns, feel heard, or express oneself effectively. It can make for a lot of frustration, because these are all things that aid flourishing.</p>
<p>Experiencing deep and prolonged anxiety can also have an impact on well-being. Placing one’s body under the physical strain of anxiety can result in ailments as diverse as muscle tension, stomachaches, headaches, and trouble sleeping well. Unfortunately, teens with anxiety disorders are at higher risk of turning to substance abuse to cope with the symptoms of anxiety. This creates additional challenges to well-being.</p>
<h3>Signs of Anxiety in a Teenager</h3>
<p>Anxiety affects teens as much as other age groups, and parents, caregivers, and teens themselves need to be aware of what the signs of anxiety are. Some of the signs or symptoms of anxiety to know include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>easily fatigued</li>
<li>feeling worried</li>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>hands or body trembling</li>
<li>heart palpitations</li>
<li>feeling irritable or nervous</li>
<li>constantly seeking reassurance</li>
<li>feeling excessively self-conscious</li>
<li>sweating</li>
<li>withdrawing from social activity</li>
<li>nausea, butterflies in the stomach</li>
<li>feeling restless, wound-up, jumpy, or on edge</li>
<li>having difficulty concentrating, and/or your mind going blank</li>
<li>experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, sleep problems, muscle tension, stomachaches, and pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking to a health professional is important. They can give medical advice and determine the potential cause of these symptoms.</p>
<h3>Helping Your Teen Overcome Anxiety</h3>
<p>Anxiety, even when it is debilitating, can be addressed. The main ways to address anxiety include self-help measures, therapy, and medication, particularly for the more severe forms of anxiety. Self-help can include taking measures to reduce stress and anxiety levels, by exercising, getting consistent quality sleep to aid emotional regulation, becoming more aware of triggers, and knowing which foods may worsen anxiety.</p>
<p>As a parent or caregiver, there are some steps you can take to help your teenager, and they include recognizing and acknowledging your teen’s emotions and fears. Instead of ignoring or dismissing their experiences, take them seriously and listen to their concerns. Listening includes not interrupting or being too quick to give solutions.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to normalize their experience, letting them know that other teens also experience anxiety. Loving them and being empathetic toward them provides them with the support they need to navigate a trying set of experiences. That can happen as part of your daily interactions with them when you carve out time daily to engage with your child in a distraction-free environment where they have your full attention.</p>
<p>A parent or caregiver can also help their teen by encouraging habits that promote well-being. You can encourage a healthy diet by providing healthy foods in the home, including snacks. You can also encourage physical activity like sports, dance, walking, running, cycling, hiking, or any other activity that promotes movement that they enjoy. You can also encourage good sleep hygiene and habits.</p>
<p>When your teen has test anxiety, there are good coping strategies they can employ, such as studying without distractions, learning how to calm themselves through controlled breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, or by envisioning success or reframing negative thoughts.</p>
<p>In other situations where anxiety is present, instead of plunging your teen headfirst into whatever they are anxious about, try to gently and slowly work up to the worry. Along the way, find means to provide positive reinforcement and support for them so that they can more effectively face whatever they are anxious about.</p>
<p>It’s also important to seek help from others, including school counselors or a trusted counselor. They can provide your teen with tools and coping strategies to better handle their anxiety. In cases where medication is necessary to address severe symptoms, it must be prescribed, and the regimen should be adhered to. You can encourage your teen to consistently attend their sessions and take their medication.</p>
<p>With help, your teen can bring their anxiety under control and have a happy and fulfilling life. To learn more and to meet with me or another counselor in our directory, contact our office today.</p>

<p>Experiencing deep and prolonged anxiety can also have an impact on well-being. Placing one’s body under the physical strain of anxiety can result in ailments as diverse as muscle tension, stomachaches, headaches, and trouble sleeping well. Unfortunately, teens with anxiety disorders are at higher risk of turning to substance abuse to cope with the symptoms of anxiety. This creates additional challenges to well-being.</p>
<h3>Signs of Anxiety in a Teenager</h3>
<p>Anxiety affects teens as much as other age groups, and parents, caregivers, and teens themselves need to be aware of what the signs of anxiety are. Some of the signs or symptoms of anxiety to know include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>easily fatigued</li>
<li>feeling worried</li>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>hands or body trembling</li>
<li>heart palpitations</li>
<li>feeling irritable or nervous</li>
<li>constantly seeking reassurance</li>
<li>feeling excessively self-conscious</li>
<li>sweating</li>
<li>withdrawing from social activity</li>
<li>nausea, butterflies in the stomach</li>
<li>feeling restless, wound-up, jumpy, or on edge</li>
<li>having difficulty concentrating, and/or your mind going blank</li>
<li>experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, sleep problems, muscle tension, stomachaches, and pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking to a health professional is important. They can give medical advice and determine the potential cause of these symptoms.</p>
<h3>Helping Your Teen Overcome Anxiety</h3>
<p>Anxiety, even when it is debilitating, can be addressed. The main ways to address anxiety include self-help measures, therapy, and medication, particularly for the more severe forms of anxiety. Self-help can include taking measures to reduce stress and anxiety levels, by exercising, getting consistent quality sleep to aid emotional regulation, becoming more aware of triggers, and knowing which foods may worsen anxiety.</p>
<p>As a parent or caregiver, there are some steps you can take to help your teenager, and they include recognizing and acknowledging your teen’s emotions and fears. Instead of ignoring or dismissing their experiences, take them seriously and listen to their concerns. Listening includes not interrupting or being too quick to give solutions.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to normalize their experience, letting them know that other teens also experience anxiety. Loving them and being empathetic toward them provides them with the support they need to navigate a trying set of experiences. That can happen as part of your daily interactions with them when you carve out time daily to engage with your child in a distraction-free environment where they have your full attention.</p>
<p>A parent or caregiver can also help their teen by encouraging habits that promote well-being. You can encourage a healthy diet by providing healthy foods in the home, including snacks. You can also encourage physical activity like sports, dance, walking, running, cycling, hiking, or any other activity that promotes movement that they enjoy. You can also encourage good sleep hygiene and habits.</p>
<p>When your teen has test anxiety, there are good coping strategies they can employ, such as studying without distractions, learning how to calm themselves through controlled breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, or by envisioning success or reframing negative thoughts.</p>
<p>In other situations where anxiety is present, instead of plunging your teen headfirst into whatever they are anxious about, try to gently and slowly work up to the worry. Along the way, find means to provide positive reinforcement and support for them so that they can more effectively face whatever they are anxious about.</p>
<p>It’s also important to seek help from others, including school counselors or a trusted counselor. They can provide your teen with tools and coping strategies to better handle their anxiety. In cases where medication is necessary to address severe symptoms, it must be prescribed, and the regimen should be adhered to. You can encourage your teen to consistently attend their sessions and take their medication.</p>
<p>With help, your teen can bring their anxiety under control and have a happy and fulfilling life. To learn more and to meet with me or another counselor in our directory, contact our office today.</p>

<title>AI in Mental Health: How Artificial Intelligence Impacts Human Psychology</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>What is artificial intelligence, or AI? Who created it? Is it helpful or hurtful? What impact does it have on human psychology? These are the questions we will explore, along with looking at emerging research to better understand this new age of artificial intelligence. In addition, is AI contributing to any systemic issues?</p>
<h3>What is artificial intelligence?</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a computer science that focuses on creating electronic systems that can address various questions ranging from learning, problem solving, decision making to perception. However, how do we apply validity to the usage of artificial intelligence? Trending AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and AI Overview, or Perplexity, have become widely used systems in the last three to five years.</p>
<p>Why do we use this AI rather than using critical thinking skills, an innate ability in all humans? To answer this question, let’s dive further into where AI came from and the intentions behind its conception.</p>
<h3>Who created it?</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence began as a simple question, “Can machines think for themselves?” that came from a British mathematician and computer science pioneer named Alan Turing in 1950. At that time, Turing focused on evaluating this theory based on separating a human and a computer and asking various questions, like the concept of a man and woman being separated for interrogation in a legal matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ai-in-mental-health-how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-human-psychology.jpg"><img alt="ai in mental health " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-85236" height="173" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ai-in-mental-health-how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-human-psychology.jpg" width="300" /></a>In Turing’s theory, if the computer could not be distinguished from a human, it was using similar thinking capacities as humans, and could thus be considered artificial intelligence. Nearly six years later, following the death of Turing, John McCarthy, a professor at Dartmouth College, created a summer program to explore the concept of thinking machines further with university students.</p>
<p>Following the Dartmouth conference in 1956, artificial intelligence was officially introduced as a research study area. By the 1960s, artificial intelligence had made such an impact in technology that the U.S. Department of Defense began investing in artificial intelligence programs.</p>
<p>However, funding for these programs by the U.S. government eventually discontinued in the 1970s, and AI did not get further attention until the 1990s and early 2000s. Now, modern computers and cell phones can process data in a completely different way, faster than ever, and provide immediate results in seconds.</p>
<h3>Is AI in mental health helpful or harmful?</h3>
<p>So, how helpful is modern AI like the platforms listed above? AI is both helpful and harmful in various environments and situations. For example, if physicians continue to use an AI program to automate their patient notes, this saves them time; however, how private is the recording, and do the recordings accurately reflect effective patient care, including basic human empathy?</p>
<p>In addition, how or who is monitoring the algorithms that may develop biases toward specific searches? In my recent experience of going to my kids’ pediatrician’s office, the doctor asked if it was okay to use AI to help with his notes. I won’t lie and say I was not surprised, but more than the lack of surprise, I was amazed at the immediate reaction of the doctor being surprised when I declined this ability.</p>
<p>Now, did that change the doctor’s perception of me? Did that impact his care of my children? More than likely not, and yet there was a psychological reaction from him, which could only be seen as frustration because he overtly favored the idea of AI helping him with his notes, and my declining to allow it made things more difficult for him. This leads to the next discussion point in this article: how does it affect human mental health?</p>
<h3>AI in Mental Health: Its Impact On Human Psychology</h3>
<p>The first aspect of understanding the impact of AI on human psychology is first to understand the capabilities of the brain in thinking. The prefrontal cortex is the primary area of the brain responsible for critical thinking, decision making, planning, and problem solving.</p>
<p><a href="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ai-in-mental-health-how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-human-psychology-2.jpg"><img alt="ai in mental health " class="alignright size-medium wp-image-85237" height="200" src="https://tacomachristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ai-in-mental-health-how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-human-psychology-2.jpg" width="300" /></a>This part of the brain is what allows humans to use both concrete and abstract thinking in their daily lives, whether this be what to wear for the day or how we resolve financial deficits in our monthly budgets. As a practitioner, the prefrontal cortex is the powerhouse behind the critical thinking capabilities necessary for forming psychopathology and treatment methods.</p>
<p>How does AI impact critical thinking skills? First, AI can be a useful tool to enhance critical thinking if it is used in moderation. However, frequent use of AI creates a dependence that deteriorates one’s ability to think independently.</p>
<p>Let’s break this down even further by using everyday examples. Let’s say you’re the type of person who responds to conflict poorly and needs assistance in articulating your feelings and/or discomfort in forming a response to conflict. You provide AI with the problem, and AI provides several ways to respond.</p>
<p>Although this seems effective, it can lead to a buildup of anxiety if you are unable to use the AI when presented with conflict. In several instances, there have been videos and articles from everyday people reporting that the answers an AI platform provided were incorrect, which only breeds less trust in your own ability to think critically.</p>
<p>In the modern world, we search for quick, easy information to substantiate our perspectives. AI has, in one sense, contributed to the current cantankerous environment we find ourselves in, where a difference of opinion leads to conflict and, in certain cases, violence. So, how is AI doing this, you ask?</p>
<p>It limits people’s capacity to think critically by providing immediate answers to prove their moral or intellectual superiority over another person. Before the era of current AI, the internet made it easier for people to find information, rather than doing what previous generations had to do to gain knowledge (i.e., reading and going to libraries).</p>
<p>In many instances, people use AI to make themselves sound professional or more academically inclined than they really are. This again leads to a potential increase in anxiety and the potential of negatively impacting interpersonal relationships.</p>
<h3>AI and Children</h3>
<p>Now let’s look at school-aged children who often use AI to assist with their schoolwork. Again, AI provides quick responses, but do we question whether the information is accurate? Going even further, our current average reading level in the United States is eighth grade, with an illiteracy rate of nearly 21% among adults in the United States.</p>
<p>How is that possible, you may ask. The decline of our reading levels is not solely due to AI; however, AI is reinforcing the lower levels of reading comprehension because it thinks for you, rather than you thinking, which also helps us to store information in the various components of our memories.</p>
<p>For example, reading teaches us the general understanding of words, which are stored in semantic memory. Reading about a practical task is stored in procedural memory and reading autobiographies that help us gain an understanding of ourselves is stored in autobiographical memory. AI gives a momentary resolution, while thinking for ourselves gives us the ability to learn and create long-term habits.</p>
<p>The final takeaway from this article is to encourage you to think critically about the information you are reading now. Do you find that you agree or disagree with this article? If you agree, why do you agree or what do you agree with about the information?</p>
<p>If you disagree with the content of the article, what was the immediate set of thoughts that came to your mind to try and counter it? This article should motivate you to reflect on your ability to think critically and assess any dependencies you may have developed in your everyday life.</p>

<title>From Burnout to Balance: Rethinking the Costs of Stress in the Workplace</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Stress is a factor of life that we experience for different reasons, at various stages of life, to differing degrees, but always with negative long-term results. Stress is the state of our body on high alert, caused by a release of hormones in the nervous system, readying us with a fight, flight, or freeze response.</p>
<p>The purpose of stress is to prepare us to survive a life-threatening situation, and this stress response could save our lives. But living in an extended survival mode has the opposite effect and can cause far more damage than good. Frequent headaches, body aches, insomnia, restlessness, and weight gain or weight loss are some of the common ways stress impacts the body.</p>
<p>Emotionally, stress can cause frustration, low self-efficacy, anger, depression, and suicidal thoughts. 1 Peter 5:7 reminds us, “Cast all of your anxiety on him because he cares for you.” There is no option to disable the stress response, but there are ways in which we might cope with, manage, or avoid situations that trigger our stress response.</p>
<p>The workplace is the source of so much of our stress, and it is also a place that is largely unavoidable. Over time, we have all developed natural ways of managing stress in the workplace. But are they healthy or sustainable? What is a healthy way to manage stress in the workplace? Jesus gives instructions for managing stress.</p>
<p>He tells us to give Him our burdens and our uncertainties, and He will give us rest. Jesus wants us to depend upon Him for everything, talk with Him about the specific work stressors, and how they’re impacting our lives. He wants us to go to Him seeking and expecting answers from Him.</p>
<h3>Good Stress</h3>
<p>Everyone responds to stressful situations differently. As humans, we crave variety and can thrive on unpredictability. If life were one note and entirely safe, we would get bored in the short term and depressed over time. We have seen the detrimental effects of stress over the years or even decades, but a little bit of stress can be helpful and invigorating.</p>
<img alt="From Burnout to Balance: Rethinking the Costs of Stress in the Workplace" class="alignleft wp-image-43946" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/from-burnout-to-balance-rethinking-the-costs-of-stress-in-the-workplace-500x333.jpg" width="300" />Without pressure of any kind, we might fail to be on time, meet deadlines, have creative thoughts, or identify helpful solutions. Certainly, some people respond wonderfully under pressure, while others crumble. There is no right or wrong response. Each one depends on a multitude of factors, including our genetic makeup and previous experience with trauma.</p>
<p>A danger arises when we cannot be productive without stress, and sadly, this is the reality in many workplaces. Bosses and executives freely exploit the neuroscience of stress to achieve maximum productivity from their staff regularly. This tactic is toxic and manipulative, and sadly, it is also effective. The results come at the expense of workers’ health.</p>
<h3>Fight, Flight, or Freeze?</h3>
<p>Our nervous system sees any stressful occurrence as a potentially fatal threat. It prepares a response to get us out of danger by releasing hormones and chemicals that will help us stay alive. These responses are quite literally a survival instinct designed to help us evade a moment of temporary danger. They are counterproductive over long periods and, frustratingly, we have no way of controlling them. How do you respond to stress?</p>
<p>Do you cave under pressure? This is the “freeze” response. It ensures your safety by internally disabling you (temporarily) until the danger has passed. Unfortunately, it isn’t helpful in a stressful environment like a workplace, where deadlines and responsibilities pile up and don’t go away. If you find yourself procrastinating, easily distracted, or unfocused during a stressful period, this could be your body’s natural “freeze” response.</p>
<p><img alt="From Burnout to Balance: Rethinking the Costs of Stress in the Workplace 1" class="alignright wp-image-43947" height="169" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/from-burnout-to-balance-rethinking-the-costs-of-stress-in-the-workplace-21-500x281.jpg" width="300" />If you are one of those people who kick into gear when crises happen, you are experiencing the “fight” response. Your body has armed you with energy and clarity of thought so that you can easily make good decisions. Our bodies can only withstand so much stress. Over time, the fight response can lead to great bodily damage, causing artery damage, which can become a precursor to stroke or heart attack risk.</p>
<p>You may have a sharpened sense of observation in these times, seeing details that others miss. This makes you valuable at the moment, but you may find yourself lacking in energy before everyone else and completely exhausted by the end of the workday. It becomes cyclical when we’re stressed and feeling inadequate, so we take on more than we should, and then we’re exhausted and encounter greater stress.</p>
<p>The third response that you might experience is the “flight” response. If you hate conflict, cannot handle the emotions that come with arguments, and would rather not have raised voices in the office, then you likely respond to stress by wanting to escape it. And, as with the “freeze” response, you might be easily distracted.</p>
<p>This is a way of avoiding tension related to stress. Avoidance is like a pressure cooker. The steam is rising to the top, but you keep putting the lid on. Although steam is escaping, eventually the lid flies off, and there’s an emotional overflow that occurs.</p>
<p>We may experience one of these responses regularly, or we may respond in various ways to various stressors. Most of the time, we are not acutely aware of how we cope with stress – we progress on autopilot. Perhaps you already have a clear idea of the way your nervous system responds to stress. Maybe you will have to pay attention and become more self-aware in the workplace to figure it out.</p>
<h3>How to Manage Stress in the Workplace According to Your Response Type</h3>
<p><strong>Strategies for the Freeze Response</strong>
<p>As someone whose nervous system helps you to “go offline” in times of crisis, you are saved from shock but not from the aftershock of the crisis. In other words, you might find it hard to respond to pressure at the time, but once the deadline has passed, you might find that you have clarity of thought. Of course, this is not helpful after the fact.</p>
<p>When clarity of thought comes, maximize it. You might find that you are not productive at certain hours when there is a lot of noise and tension, but you can think more clearly when it’s calmer.</p>
<p>You might not have linked a noisy or busy environment to your lack of productivity, but chances are that your nervous system was aware of the “threat”. If you can restructure your work hours, or if you can identify when you are most productive, capitalize on those hours. Remember that procrastination is often a sign that you are struggling to cope.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="From Burnout to Balance: Rethinking the Costs of Stress in the Workplace 2" class="alignleft wp-image-43948" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/from-burnout-to-balance-rethinking-the-costs-of-stress-in-the-workplace-2-375x500.jpg" width="225" />Strategies for the Fight Response</strong></p>
<p>People with the fight response rise to the challenges and enjoy facing them. This can be an addictive feeling. After all, it is wonderful to be good at something. Unfortunately, this means that you will likely take work issues home, even if only in your mind. The tendency to not be able to switch off comes with this territory, and you risk facing burnout in the future if you do not learn to manage your stress response.</p>
<p>It will be beneficial for you to practice setting up boundaries, both in your working environment and at home (to keep work separate). At work, this could look like prioritizing your time better. By focusing on a single task at hand and not trying to multitask, you might find it easier to complete tasks and with less stress.</p>
<p>Practice not working in the evenings and not responding to anything other than vital work correspondence at home. You could redirect your build-up of energy into a hobby, family, or relationship. If you are exhausted by the end of the working day, prioritize relaxation when you get home. Find a pursuit that calms you and try to do it at least twice a week.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for the Flight Response</strong></p>
<p>This may be the most difficult reaction of all. The flight response to workplace stress often looks like procrastination, poor communication, and feelings of being constantly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>If you experience this response, you will know that avoiding pressure makes them worse. A full inbox of emails, a stack of paperwork, or a list of calls to make can feel like an insurmountable obstacle that you would rather ignore.</p>
<p>When you find yourself in this emotional space, try thinking this: the only way out is through. Your nervous system might be trying to protect you from harm, but to clear a backlog of work, you just have to do it.</p>
<p>You cannot conquer a mountain in one leap. But if you pick one achievable task and do it, and then check it off the list for today, in no time you will make real progress. It’s about building a rhythm to gain momentum.</p>
<p>Don’t attempt too much at once. Rather, begin with a list of three to five achievable tasks and give yourself a time frame to complete them (say, before lunch or by the end of the day). This will train you to prioritize tasks.</p>
<p>Other coping skills that can help include keeping a memory verse/affirmation or Scripture near your desk or in your phone and reading it several times throughout the day. One Scripture that may help you begin is Psalm 46:1: “God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.”</p>
<img alt="From Burnout to Balance: Rethinking the Costs of Stress in the Workplace 3" class="alignright wp-image-43949" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/from-burnout-to-balance-rethinking-the-costs-of-stress-in-the-workplace-3-333x500.jpg" width="200" />Also, journaling for 3-5 minutes during your workday to acknowledge your feelings and give place to them can also help, which can then be followed up later in the day or week as a prayer journal entry to God. Listening to a mini sermon or encouraging song can provide relief. Furthermore, you could do a simple act of gratitude. Sometimes stepping outside of ourselves is helpful, and it demonstrates the love of Christ.</p>
<p>Maybe bring coffee/tea or snacks into work, offer a genuine compliment or help a coworker with a work-related task, assuming it will not cause you further stress. Stress will happen and will continue to happen, but if you begin recognizing your stress triggers, you can quickly address them before they reach a state of complete alarm.</p>
<p>Lastly, it may also pay to focus on improving your communication. Many people who experience a flight response are also afraid of confrontation and struggle to manage other people’s expectations of them.</p>
<p>If you can be open about when you feel unprepared, when you are at your limit, or when you are struggling to keep afloat, you may find a lot of that fear response disappearing. Remember, we can’t control other people’s actions; we can only control our responses to those actions, and the depth of our response to those actions.</p>
<h3>Further Steps to Manage Stress in the Workplace</h3>
<p>If managing work stress is becoming unbearable and unmanageable, we recommend talking with a professional counselor or therapist to work out the best method of stress management for you. There are counselors ready to hear and to help. Call us today to make your appointment.</p>

<title>Christian Family Counseling During a Crisis</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>There is never a “good time” for a family crisis. Whether things seem good or not, family crises rock people to their core. Whether it is a turn in the financial markets, the economy, the sudden discovery of infidelity, or the sudden death of a loved one, a family crisis has the potential to destroy family cohesion and end marriages.</p>
<p>For Christian families, these situations become more complex. There are certain things they must weigh when walking out their faith throughout the crisis that honor Christ while still allowing room for them to recognize they are human.</p>
<p>This is when it can be helpful to have a healthy counseling experience that not only focuses on the crisis at hand but also allows room to ask the hard questions about faith. This is where Christian family counseling can be an essential tool for navigating the chaos of a family crisis.</p>
<p>The issue often runs deeper than just finding a solution to an immediate problem. It will reflect the cultural message that a Christian family receives about perfection, strength, and having it all together. This thought process creates an impossible situation where maintaining a faithful appearance contradicts the desperate need for authentic help. Families often feel trapped between demonstrating strength in their faith and acknowledging their struggles.</p>
<h3>Understanding Family Crisis Through a Biblical Lens</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, not all family crises are the direct result of some spiritual or moral failure. To understand faith in Christ during a time of crisis is to remember that we live in a fallen and broken creation.</p>
<p>Scripture teaches that “the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time” (Romans 8:20-22).</p>
<img alt="Christian Family Counseling During a Crisis 1" class="alignleft wp-image-43940" height="200" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/christian-family-counseling-during-a-crisis-2-500x334.jpg" width="300" />It is in these times of crisis that we can grow deeper in our faith in Christ, as He tends to draw us closer in these times.</p>
<p>Christian counselors approach a family crisis with an understanding that each family is unique in its pain and requires individualized attention. The approach to healing works differently in every situation for every family. Some may be struggling with generational patterns of dysfunction that have been passed down, while others face sudden trauma that has blindsided the stability of their home.</p>
<p>A Christ-centered approach cultivates the ability to address both the psychological and spiritual dimensions of family pain. Traditional therapy typically focuses on behavioral changes or communication patterns. In Christian family counseling, healing often requires addressing the spiritual wounds that are related to trauma.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. – </em><strong>Psalm 46:1-3, NIV</strong></blockquote>
<h3>Christian Family Counseling Approaches to Crisis Intervention</h3>
<p>Christian family counseling approaches to crisis intervention start by creating safe boundaries in the therapeutic relationship. Families in crisis often feel exposed and vulnerable. They wonder if their struggles will be met with judgment or superficial spiritual well-wishes. Christian counselors understand that genuine healing needs professional competence and spiritual sensitivity.</p>
<p>The intervention process used in Christian family counseling typically involves helping family members identify their individual roles in the crisis. This process emphasizes avoiding trying to place blame and shame. Instead, it focuses on honesty and individual experiences while pointing to Christian truths.</p>
<p>In terms of applying Christian principles, this can mean working through the process when sitting across from someone who has caused the pain. It isn’t about who did the worst thing or gives the most forgiveness. It’s about applying the Christian principle to reach the point where the family can pursue long-lasting healing.</p>

<p>Prayer is a central component of the healing process, but not in a way some expect. Christian family counseling uses<br />
prayer as a way to invite God’s presence into the painful places of the crisis. This is where the family has hidden the hurt. This cultivates space for honesty and vulnerability that is needed, but may not otherwise exist.</p>
<p>Therapeutic techniques connect biblical principles with practices like confession, forgiveness, and restoration. They’re not spiritual buzz words. They are practical tools that require skilled guidance to implement effectively to create avenues of transformation. Many families attempt this process without the guidance of a Christian counselor and create more damage due to the lack of proper support.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As iron sharpens iron,</em> <em>so one person sharpens another.</em> – <strong>Proverbs 27:17, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Christian Family Counseling Communication Restoration</h3>
<p>The process of Christian family counseling communication restoration requires intentional effort, and it can often feel like learning a new language. Family members will be required to express themselves in ways that build each other up rather than tear each other down. The old patterns of interaction that may have played a part in the crisis need to be identified and replaced with a healthier alternative.</p>
<p>This is not a quick or easy process, especially because the emotions are raw and the wounds are fresh. Creating a safe space for these honest dialogues will require establishing ground rules to protect each family member’s dignity and allow for the authentic expression of both pain and hope.</p>
<p>Christian counselors can help families navigate this delicate balance by teaching communication skills that honor truth with love and respect. Even with the expression of pain, the hope is to foster genuine understanding.</p>
<p>Many families discovered their crisis revealed communication patterns that were problematic long before the situation developed. The deeper disconnection may have been building long before the affair, the addiction, or the rebellious teenager. This is a devastating realization that can be hopeful, as it will provide a roadmap for genuine healing.</p>
<p>Restoring trust happens in small increments through the consistent actions of each family member over time. Christian families often struggle with the tension between extending grace and establishing healthy boundaries that protect everyone involved. There may be pressure to forgive quickly and move on, but authentic healing requires processing the pain thoroughly before true forgiveness can occur and relationships are restored.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.</em> – <strong>Ephesians 4:29, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Long-Term Healing and Spiritual Growth</h3>
<p>Long-term healing and spiritual growth reach beyond crisis management and into transformation. Christian families who successfully navigate a crisis with Christian family counseling will discover that their relationship with God and each other has actually deepened through this crisis. It doesn’t minimize the pain they’ve experienced, but it does provide a sense of meaning and purpose to the suffering.</p>
<p>Faith-based practices can help build resilience through developing spiritual disciplines that will sustain families through future challenges. This could include regular family prayer times, scripture study, or opportunities to serve that will help family members focus beyond their own struggles.</p>
<p>The goal is not to go back to the way life was before the crisis. That foundation has proven to be unable to withstand the challenges of chaos. The objective becomes to build a new foundation that is stronger and more authentic to weather future challenges together as a family with greater stability and hope.</p>
<p>Families often find that the crisis becomes a catalyst to break generational patterns of dysfunction. This helps establish healthier legacies and understand the redemption of the pain that leads to genuine change.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</em> – <strong>Romans 8:28, NIV</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Consider Christian Family Counseling</h3>
<p>Christian family counseling understands that healing is an ongoing journey rather than a destination when it comes to a family crisis. It’s not about graduating from the need for intentional, relationship-building, and spiritual growth. It is about building an authentic and fulfilling family life, rooted in the love and grace of Christ.</p>
<p>For families currently in crisis, there is hope. The storm doesn’t define the future, and the pain is not the definition of your faith. The chaos you’re experiencing will become the foundation for a deeper healing and stronger family relationships. Christian family counseling offers a way forward to honor your need for help and your desire to align your family with God’s purposes.</p>
<p>The journey isn’t easy, but it is possible, and you will not have to walk it alone. Reach out to me or one of the other counselors at our office to get started.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Anxiety and anger are emotional responses that can be triggered by a perceived threat or loss of control and often go hand in hand. In many ways, they are like two sides of the same coin – fear or anticipation of danger giving rise to anxiety, and anger surfacing as a defensive reaction to it.</p>
<p>Both emotions spring from the body’s fight-or-flight stress response, trigger similar hormonal surges and physiological responses in the brain, and share matching physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, muscle tension, and rapid breathing. This connection enables them to fuel one another, with anxiety being the driving force behind anger, or vice versa, and it is not uncommon to experience them together or interchangeably.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of Anxiety That Can Turn to Anger</h3>
<p><strong>Irritability</strong> Irritability is a less intense kind of anger, and is one of the most common symptoms of anxiety that has been triggered by prolonged worry or unease. It can be accompanied by restlessness and muscle tension, which exacerbate it, diminish your tolerance, and eventually cause it to morph into full-blown anger.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive distortions </strong>Cognitive distortions are irrational or exaggerated thought patterns, such as catastrophizing and overgeneralization, that are often characteristic of anxiety and that fuel anger by creating a distorted perception of reality.</p>
<h3>Examples of Anger Issues Caused by Anxiety</h3>
<p>Not all anger issues are caused by anxiety, but anxiety that is not addressed usually leads to frustration, and frustration to anxiety-related anger.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, a situation that does not go according to plan. You feel uncertain and full of anxiety about what the outcome will be. Increasing agitation and frustration about your circumstances, the people involved, and the impact it is having on your life can culminate in anger. This anger can be directed outwardly at others or turned inwardly toward yourself.</p>
<p>Or, you may feel anxious or scared about something, but lash out in anger to mask it. This can be because anger seems like a more socially acceptable response than the perceived weakness associated with anxiety or fear, and because it provides you with a temporary sense of power and control.</p>
<p>Other factors that can contribute to and exacerbate an anxious person’s predisposition to anger include sleep deprivation, changes or disruptions to their daily routine, and excessive stress.</p>
<h3>Practical Coping Strategies for Managing Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Anger</h3>
<p><strong>Learn to recognize the early signs </strong>An important first step in managing anxiety and preventing it from escalating into anger is learning how to recognize the early signs of frustration, agitation, or irritability.</p>
<p><strong>Identify your triggers </strong>Notice what types of situations and interactions cause you to feel anxious, and look for what it is about them that makes them turn into anger. (You may need the help of a trained mental health professional to unpack the connection.)</p>
<p><strong>Question your thinking </strong>Ask yourself what the likelihood is that what you are feeling anxious about would actually come to pass, and try to see things from a more rational, realistic perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Engage in regular exercise </strong>Exercise is a healthy, productive way to release pent-up energy and frustration, and prevent anger from escalating. Studies have shown that it supports overall physical and mental well-being. It also helps manage symptoms of both anxiety and anger by reducing stress hormones, releasing mood-boosting endorphins into the bloodstream, enhancing muscle relaxation, and building confidence and self-control.</p>
<p><strong>Spend time outdoors </strong>Spending time outdoors boosts your mood. Studies indicate that walking in a park or a treed area for 10 to 15 minutes can help reduce heart rate and blood pressure, have a calming effect on your body and mind, decrease feelings of stress, anxiety, and anger, and uplift your mood.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="Anxiety and Anger: Is There a Connection?" class="alignleft wp-image-43932" height="300" src="https://bellevuechristiancounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anxiety-and-anger-is-there-a-connection-500x500.jpg" width="300" />Practice grounding yourself with mindfulness techniques </strong>When you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or anger, mindfulness techniques can interrupt the cycle. They can help you regain your composure by having you accept your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without judging or trying to interpret or change them.</p>
<p>Using your five senses to redirect your attention to the present moment instead of ruminating about the past or being anxious about the future helps you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on your breathing </strong>Deep, slow breathing is another grounding technique that can help reduce stress and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and anger. Focusing on your breath shifts your attention away from triggering thoughts, feelings, and sensations, activates your body’s relaxation response, helps calm your nervous system, and enables you to center yourself and think more rationally.</p>
<p><strong>Implement timeouts in emotionally charged situations </strong>Learn to recognize the physical and emotional cues that signal a situation is becoming emotionally charged. Then, physically remove yourself before anger or anxiety has a chance to escalate.</p>
<p>Explain to the other person that you need a timeout to cool down and will return to continue the conversation as soon as you do. Timeouts give you a chance to regain your composure and see things from a clearer, more rational perspective. It can prevent you from impulsively saying or doing something you may later regret.</p>
<p><strong>Use mindful pauses </strong>Whether it is by taking a few deep breaths or counting slowly to ten before responding, a mindful pause involves intentionally taking a brief moment to calm down, refocus, and regain perspective before reacting impulsively to a triggering situation. It gives you a chance to think before you speak or act. Instead of saying or doing the first thing that comes to mind, you can help keep your emotions from escalating.</p>
<p><strong>Journal </strong>Writing down your thoughts, feelings, and sensations helps create some space between you and them by getting them out of your head and onto paper. It can also help you identify patterns and triggers, and see things from different perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Practice being solution-oriented </strong>Anxiety and anger tend to keep you defensively focused on potential threats and how others are responsible for your problems. Look, instead, for ways to shift your focus from external blame to internal reflection on your part, and healthy ways you can solve them.</p>
<p><strong>Seek professional help </strong>A trained mental health professional can help you unpack and address what’s at the core of your anxiety and anger and the things that trigger them. They can equip you with coping skills to help you regulate these emotions and manage the stressors in your life that lead to them.</p>
<h3>Effective Treatments For Anxiety And Anxiety-Fueled Anger Disorders</h3>
<p>The most effective treatments involve a combination of therapy and lifestyle adjustments, such as the following:</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): </strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy is a gold standard, evidence-based form of therapy that has been recognized as highly effective in treating anxiety and anger disorders. Its premise is that your thoughts influence your emotions and behaviors.</p>
<p>The goal of CBT is to teach you how to recognize and reframe dysfunctional thought patterns that lead to erroneous conclusions and distort your view of reality. It can then equip you with strategies to manage your triggers and respond to them in healthier, more effective ways.</p>
<p><strong>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) </strong>Dialectical behavior therapy is a modified form of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness skills. Its focus is on teaching you how to manage intense emotions and stressful situations without resorting to impulsive or destructive behaviors, develop healthy coping skills, and improve your interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness and relaxation techniques </strong>Mindfulness and relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and grounding techniques can help you learn how to deal with anxiety and anger more effectively.</p>
<p>You can learn to control some of the physical symptoms by focusing on the present moment, relaxing and calming your body, and reducing feelings of reactivity or judgment. These techniques may be incorporated into other forms of therapy or used as standalone interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy lifestyle choices </strong>Healthy lifestyle choices can help improve your overall emotional health and sense of well-being, as well as your ability to manage anger and anxiety. Regular exercise, for instance, can help limit the amount of stress hormones in your body, as well as improve the quality of your sleep.</p>
<p>Eating a balanced, nutritious diet and staying hydrated can improve and stabilize your mood. Getting enough sleep can help regulate stress hormones, improve cognitive processing, decrease anxiety, and increase your resilience to stress.</p>
